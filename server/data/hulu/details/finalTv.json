High risk is their business and life-and-death stakes are their world. The SRU team is also unique; they rescue hostages, bust gangs, defuse bombs, climb buildings, see through walls and talk down suicidal teens. It takes years on the street, intense physical conditioning and elite marksmanship to qualify for the SRU. They have to prove that they’re at the top of their game on a daily basis because if they’re not, there are hundreds of others willing to step in and take their place. The team uses state-of-the-art equipment – sniper rifles, snake-cameras, robots, flash-bangs, night-vision and tasers. But beyond all of the cool gadgetry, the most important weapons in their arsenal are human intuition, a gift for words and their ability to read emotion. Each team member is uniquely trained in negotiating, profiling and getting inside a subject’s head. They stand out because of the rare balance between lethal hardware and people skills: pure muscle and pure intuition. They’re the envy of law enforcement everywhere. The stakes are always high in Flashpoint – only here, the lives of the men and women on the team are also always on the line. That’s the nature of the job. The SRU may be heroes, but they are also human. At the end of the day, they each go home haunted by what they’ve seen, by what they’ve had to do – pursued by new demons which they cram into already bulging closets. They lock down emotion and they second-guess decisions made in the heat of the moment. These individuals are constant witnesses to the extremes of human distress. Not everyone is cut out for this. If you’re a cop, you’re three times more likely to kill yourself than to be killed by a bad guy.","duration":"","imdbScore":"7.7"},{"title":"Full Metal Panic!","href":"https://www.hulu.com/series/full-metal-panic-348dc05a-07e2-40e7-8e47-f47067a61e4b","subgenres":["Action","Anime","Science Fiction"],"id":"full-metal-panic-348dc05a-07e2-40e7-8e47-f47067a61e4b","year":"2002","rating":"TVPG","description":"Sousuke Sagara, a seventeen year old military specialist working for the secret organization MITHRIL, has been assigned to protect the latest \"Whispered\" candidate Kaname Chidori.

Kirk a century earlier, and, accordingly, it carries a larger crew complement: 1,012 men, women…and, surprisingly, children.  This era’s Starfleet Command believes that men and women are more likely to sign up for long-term exploratory missions if they think of their ship as home. Thus, Picard’s crew enjoys many of the comforts they’d have otherwise left behind, including a wide variety of recreational opportunities, “replicated” food dishes to suit every palate, and quarters large enough to share with spouses and offspring. There are schools for the children and a bar (stocked with synthetic alcohol, or synthehol) where the adults can unwind.

With their star charts mostly empty, they’ll have to prove they’re ready for life among the stars.","duration":"","imdbScore":"7.5"},{"title":"Star Trek: The Next Generation","href":"https://www.hulu.com/series/star-trek-the-next-generation-4c8988f3-da68-44ce-8277-20d9b7978abf","subgenres":["Action","Adventure","Classics","Drama","Family","Science Fiction"],"id":"star-trek-the-next-generation-4c8988f3-da68-44ce-8277-20d9b7978abf","year":"1989","rating":"TVPG","description":"Star Trek: The Next Generation (TNG) focuses on the 24th century adventures of Captain Jean-Luc Picard aboard the U.S.S. Enterprise (NCC-1701-D). This incarnation of the famous starship is much larger than the one captained by James T. Kirk a century earlier, and, accordingly, it carries a larger crew complement: 1,012 men, women…and, surprisingly, children.  This era’s Starfleet Command believes that men and women are more likely to sign up for long-term exploratory missions if they think of their ship as home. Thus, Picard’s crew enjoys many of the comforts they’d have otherwise left behind, including a wide variety of recreational opportunities, “replicated” food dishes to suit every palate, and quarters large enough to share with spouses and offspring. There are schools for the children and a bar (stocked with synthetic alcohol, or synthehol) where the adults can unwind. However, the ongoing mission—no longer limited to a mere five years—remains virtually the same as it was during Kirk’s time: to seek out new life and new civilizations, and to boldly go where no one has gone before.","duration":"","imdbScore":"8.6"},{"title":"Star Trek: The Original Series","href":"https://www.hulu.com/series/star-trek-the-original-series-26f1ae35-0abd-4828-8786-7752ae7998d5","subgenres":["Action","Adventure","Classics","Drama","Family","Science Fiction"],"id":"star-trek-the-original-series-26f1ae35-0abd-4828-8786-7752ae7998d5","year":"1966","rating":"TVPG","description":"The 23rd century adventures of Captain James T.

Kirk a century earlier, and, accordingly, it carries a larger crew complement: 1,012 men, women…and, surprisingly, children.  This era’s Starfleet Command believes that men and women are more likely to sign up for long-term exploratory missions if they think of their ship as home.

There are schools for the children and a bar (stocked with synthetic alcohol, or synthehol) where the adults can unwind.

The program’s depiction of a “typical” mid-century, middle-class, Midwestern American family is fondly remembered by many of us who grew up watching the show and rather enviously thinking: “Oh. So this is what happens in all the other houses.” \n\nMargaret Anderson (Jane Wyatt) charmed us as the levelheaded domestic diva who stood faithfully behind the strong and benevolent father. Their three children—sophisticated teen Betty (Elinor Donahue), chronically befuddled 14-year-old brother “Bud” (Billy Gray) and precocious little sister Kathy (Lauren Chapin)—faced the challenges of growing up right alongside of us. And in episode after episode, Jim and Margaret treated their children’s youthful transgressions with authority, empathy and wisdom. By the end of each half hour, we’d all learned our lesson. \n\nJoin Jim and Margaret and “Princess,” “Bud” and “Kitten” in their very first year as everyone’s favorite ’50s family in Father Knows Best. \"","duration":"","imdbScore":"7.4"},{"title":"Flophouse","href":"https://www.hulu.com/series/flophouse-d21c0cff-dff8-48b7-a6d2-92cc2add20dd","subgenres":["Comedy","Reality","Stand Up"],"id":"flophouse-d21c0cff-dff8-48b7-a6d2-92cc2add20dd","year":"2016","rating":"TV14","description":"Up-and-coming comedians live together while working toward their dreams of success.","duration":"","imdbScore":"5.5"},{"title":"Flying Witch","href":"https://www.hulu.com/series/flying-witch-04cba47c-5f65-464a-96f2-2ec6ca3d17f4","subgenres":["Anime","Comedy"],"id":"flying-witch-04cba47c-5f65-464a-96f2-2ec6ca3d17f4","year":"2016","rating":"TVPG","description":"When a witch turns fifteen, it is her duty to move out and begin work.

But she has let herself go over the years and is now overweight and often disregarded and overlooked by society and her coworkers. On the plane ride back from a quick business trip to the United States, Joo Eun has an embarrassing run-in with Kim Yeong Ho (So Ji Sub) and his two sidekicks, Jang Joon Seong (Sung Hoon) and Kim Ji Woong (Henry). Yeong Ho is a celebrity personal trainer who is involved in a scandal in the United States and forced to flee to Korea until things cool down. But his wealthy family has other plans for him. As soon as they discover that he is back in Korea, his grandmother appoints Yeong Ho as the new president of the family medical services company and prevents him from returning to the States. A lost purse causes Young Ho to reconnect with Joo Eun and witness another personal embarrassment for Joo Eun in the aftermath of being dumped by Woo Sik and finding out that he has been dating her new boss, Oh Soo Jin (Yoo In Young). As it seems to become a habit for Yeong Ho to bail Joo Eun out of trouble, can he also help her to reclaim her former looks? \"Oh My Venus\" is a 2015 South Korean drama series directed by Kim Hyung Suk.","duration":"","imdbScore":"7.9"},{"title":"One-Punch Man","href":"https://www.hulu.com/series/one-punch-man-54a25fcf-a472-4d40-9968-13e2957e5abf","subgenres":["Action","Adventure","Anime","Comedy"],"id":"one-punch-man-54a25fcf-a472-4d40-9968-13e2957e5abf","year":"2015","rating":"TVMA","description":"Saitama only became a hero for fun, but after three years of “special” training, he finds that he can beat even the mightiest opponents with a single punch.

The Heathens were on the brink of becoming famous for their kickass live shows and the release of their highly anticipated first album. Until they broke up. The same day the album dropped. Because lead guitarist Flash (John Corbett) found Johnny in bed with his wife. So the band became legendary for all the wrong reasons - like self-destructing sooner than any group in rock-n-roll history. 25 years later, the only thing bigger than Johnny’s ego is his prostate. The drugs he really needs now aren’t cocaine and marijuana – they’re Crestor, Cymbalta and Cialis. He’s out of work, out of money and out of show business options. That’s when a massively talented young singer named Gigi (Elizabeth Gillies) shows up - with a burning desire to be famous, a throwback appreciation for The Heathens’ only album, and a stack of cash big enough to bring the whole band back into the studio. Only this time, SHE’S the lead singer and Johnny’s just a behind-the-scenes songwriter. John Ales, Bobby Kelly and Elaine Hendrix round out the rest of this dysfunctional rock and roll family.

High risk is their business and life-and-death stakes are their world. The SRU team is also unique; they rescue hostages, bust gangs, defuse bombs, climb buildings, see through walls and talk down suicidal teens. It takes years on the street, intense physical conditioning and elite marksmanship to qualify for the SRU. They have to prove that they’re at the top of their game on a daily basis because if they’re not, there are hundreds of others willing to step in and take their place. The team uses state-of-the-art equipment – sniper rifles, snake-cameras, robots, flash-bangs, night-vision and tasers. But beyond all of the cool gadgetry, the most important weapons in their arsenal are human intuition, a gift for words and their ability to read emotion. Each team member is uniquely trained in negotiating, profiling and getting inside a subject’s head. They stand out because of the rare balance between lethal hardware and people skills: pure muscle and pure intuition. They’re the envy of law enforcement everywhere. The stakes are always high in Flashpoint – only here, the lives of the men and women on the team are also always on the line. That’s the nature of the job. The SRU may be heroes, but they are also human. At the end of the day, they each go home haunted by what they’ve seen, by what they’ve had to do – pursued by new demons which they cram into already bulging closets. They lock down emotion and they second-guess decisions made in the heat of the moment. These individuals are constant witnesses to the extremes of human distress. Not everyone is cut out for this. If you’re a cop, you’re three times more likely to kill yourself than to be killed by a bad guy.","duration":"","imdbScore":"7.7"},{"title":"GANGSTA.","href":"https://www.hulu.com/series/gangsta-1f65ce19-aff4-457b-971d-b6f491e89268","subgenres":["Action","Adventure","Anime","Crime"],"id":"gangsta-1f65ce19-aff4-457b-971d-b6f491e89268","year":"2015","rating":"TVMA","description":"Working independently, taking jobs from both the mafia and police, the charming Worick and super-powered Nicolas are unique Handy Men who navigate the seedy underworld of Ergastulum in style leaving a trail of chaos behind them.","duration":"","imdbScore":"6.8"},{"title":"The Glades","href":"https://www.hulu.com/series/the-glades-3430ba30-20cd-4c14-88be-44d7a0a9b8e4","subgenres":["Crime","Drama"],"id":"the-glades-3430ba30-20cd-4c14-88be-44d7a0a9b8e4","year":"2010","rating":"TV14","description":"A&E's dramatic series The Glades follows Jim Longworth, an attractive, brilliant, yet hard to get along with homicide detective from Chicago.

But until now, nobody has undertaken a comprehensive look at super-orgasmic women – women who can experience over a hundred orgasms in any one sexual encounter. A new study by Canada’s prestigious McGill University, for the first time reveals statistics and testimonies from over 450 super-orgasmic women. Some of them can experience 10 orgasms - while others come hundreds of times, experiencing hours of pleasure. They vary in age and background, but have one thing in common: they are all still a mystery to scientists, as what actually happens to them has never been studied. But that’s all about to change. A group of super-orgasmic women who took part in the Canadian study are taking it to the next stage. They will now go into the laboratory and meet the best sex scientists in the world. The aim is to reveal if the orgasms are all in their heads or can we prove and somehow measure that this endless chain of pleasure is really happening? By deploying fMRI (functional magnetic resonance imaging) scans, scientists will be monitoring changes in blood flow to the brain, looking at which parts are most active and shedding light on what these women feel during orgasm. Past fMRI studies about single orgasms have seen scientists disagree – but what will this new research reveal and will we be any closer to understanding why some women are super-orgasmic?","duration":"","imdbScore":"N/A"},{"title":"Nightmare Next Door","href":"https://www.hulu.com/series/nightmare-next-door-c5ab8bf9-d6ed-4017-91c3-cfb481b3d747","subgenres":["Crime","Documentaries"],"id":"nightmare-next-door-c5ab8bf9-d6ed-4017-91c3-cfb481b3d747","year":"2013","rating":"TV14","description":"How well do you know your neighbors?

High risk is their business and life-and-death stakes are their world. The SRU team is also unique; they rescue hostages, bust gangs, defuse bombs, climb buildings, see through walls and talk down suicidal teens. It takes years on the street, intense physical conditioning and elite marksmanship to qualify for the SRU. They have to prove that they’re at the top of their game on a daily basis because if they’re not, there are hundreds of others willing to step in and take their place. The team uses state-of-the-art equipment – sniper rifles, snake-cameras, robots, flash-bangs, night-vision and tasers. But beyond all of the cool gadgetry, the most important weapons in their arsenal are human intuition, a gift for words and their ability to read emotion. Each team member is uniquely trained in negotiating, profiling and getting inside a subject’s head. They stand out because of the rare balance between lethal hardware and people skills: pure muscle and pure intuition. They’re the envy of law enforcement everywhere. The stakes are always high in Flashpoint – only here, the lives of the men and women on the team are also always on the line. That’s the nature of the job. The SRU may be heroes, but they are also human. At the end of the day, they each go home haunted by what they’ve seen, by what they’ve had to do – pursued by new demons which they cram into already bulging closets. They lock down emotion and they second-guess decisions made in the heat of the moment. These individuals are constant witnesses to the extremes of human distress. Not everyone is cut out for this. If you’re a cop, you’re three times more likely to kill yourself than to be killed by a bad guy.","duration":"","imdbScore":"7.7"},{"title":"Food Wars!","href":"https://www.hulu.com/series/food-wars-c3f514cd-df5e-47eb-9ab1-6e11236ef4f6","subgenres":["Anime","Comedy","Drama"],"id":"food-wars-c3f514cd-df5e-47eb-9ab1-6e11236ef4f6","year":"2015","rating":"TVMA","description":"Souma is a teenage chef who is always looking for the perfect flavors and combinations in his art, the art of cooking.

Kirk a century earlier, and, accordingly, it carries a larger crew complement: 1,012 men, women…and, surprisingly, children.  This era’s Starfleet Command believes that men and women are more likely to sign up for long-term exploratory missions if they think of their ship as home. Thus, Picard’s crew enjoys many of the comforts they’d have otherwise left behind, including a wide variety of recreational opportunities, “replicated” food dishes to suit every palate, and quarters large enough to share with spouses and offspring. There are schools for the children and a bar (stocked with synthetic alcohol, or synthehol) where the adults can unwind. However, the ongoing mission—no longer limited to a mere five years—remains virtually the same as it was during Kirk’s time: to seek out new life and new civilizations, and to boldly go where no one has gone before.","duration":"","imdbScore":"8.6"},{"title":"Star Trek: The Original Series","href":"https://www.hulu.com/series/star-trek-the-original-series-26f1ae35-0abd-4828-8786-7752ae7998d5","subgenres":["Action","Adventure","Classics","Drama","Family","Science Fiction"],"id":"star-trek-the-original-series-26f1ae35-0abd-4828-8786-7752ae7998d5","year":"1966","rating":"TVPG","description":"The 23rd century adventures of Captain James T.

The series was a launching pad for a slew of legendary comedians and artists, from director Garry Marshall and actress Rose Marie to comedians Jerry Farr and Don Rickles.\n\nStorylines deal with Rob Petrie and his two coworkers, Buddy and Sally, who write material for a television variety show.  Mel Cooley, a balding straight man is the show's producer and the brother-in-law of Alan Brady, the show's seldom-seen star. Other stories focus on the home life of Rob and Laura, who live in suburban New Rochelle, New York.

The program’s depiction of a “typical” mid-century, middle-class, Midwestern American family is fondly remembered by many of us who grew up watching the show and rather enviously thinking: “Oh. So this is what happens in all the other houses.” \n\nMargaret Anderson (Jane Wyatt) charmed us as the levelheaded domestic diva who stood faithfully behind the strong and benevolent father. Their three children—sophisticated teen Betty (Elinor Donahue), chronically befuddled 14-year-old brother “Bud” (Billy Gray) and precocious little sister Kathy (Lauren Chapin)—faced the challenges of growing up right alongside of us. And in episode after episode, Jim and Margaret treated their children’s youthful transgressions with authority, empathy and wisdom. By the end of each half hour, we’d all learned our lesson. \n\nJoin Jim and Margaret and “Princess,” “Bud” and “Kitten” in their very first year as everyone’s favorite ’50s family in Father Knows Best. \"","duration":"","imdbScore":"7.4"},{"title":"Find Me in Paris","href":"https://www.hulu.com/series/find-me-in-paris-762251c9-09f9-44f2-a46b-fdc78f265d74","subgenres":["Family","Kids","Lifestyle & Culture","Science Fiction"],"id":"find-me-in-paris-762251c9-09f9-44f2-a46b-fdc78f265d74","year":"2018","rating":"TVPG","description":"When Lena Grisky, a Russian Princess and student at the Paris Opera Ballet School accidentally time travels to present day, she must quickly adapt if she hopes to keep her secret and hide from the dangerous Time Collectors.","duration":"","imdbScore":"8.3"},{"title":"Fixer Upper","href":"https://www.hulu.com/series/fixer-upper-29f6df10-e8e5-4941-a21a-6252ea0c476b","subgenres":["Family","Lifestyle & Culture","Reality"],"id":"fixer-upper-29f6df10-e8e5-4941-a21a-6252ea0c476b","year":"2014","rating":"TVG","description":"Design and remodeling pros Chip and Joanna Gaines convince home buyers to buy the worst house on the block and make it beautiful.

Kirk a century earlier, and, accordingly, it carries a larger crew complement: 1,012 men, women…and, surprisingly, children.  This era’s Starfleet Command believes that men and women are more likely to sign up for long-term exploratory missions if they think of their ship as home. Thus, Picard’s crew enjoys many of the comforts they’d have otherwise left behind, including a wide variety of recreational opportunities, “replicated” food dishes to suit every palate, and quarters large enough to share with spouses and offspring. There are schools for the children and a bar (stocked with synthetic alcohol, or synthehol) where the adults can unwind. However, the ongoing mission—no longer limited to a mere five years—remains virtually the same as it was during Kirk’s time: to seek out new life and new civilizations, and to boldly go where no one has gone before.","duration":"","imdbScore":"8.6"},{"title":"Star Trek: The Original Series","href":"https://www.hulu.com/series/star-trek-the-original-series-26f1ae35-0abd-4828-8786-7752ae7998d5","subgenres":["Action","Adventure","Classics","Drama","Family","Science Fiction"],"id":"star-trek-the-original-series-26f1ae35-0abd-4828-8786-7752ae7998d5","year":"1966","rating":"TVPG","description":"The 23rd century adventures of Captain James T.

They decide to break off their budding relationship as a result. Dae Young also tries to break off his relationship with Army doctor Yoon Myung Ju (Kim Ji Won) because her father, Lt. General Yoon (Kang Shin Il), thinks Si Jin is a better match for his daughter. Si Jin and Dae Young are then deployed to the fictional war-torn country of Urk on a long-term assignment of helping the United Nations keep peace in the area. After repeatedly being passed over for a promotion because of her lack of connections, Mo Yeon gives up performing surgeries, loosening her principles somewhat to become a celebrity TV doctor and caring for VIP patients at the hospital. But when she refuses the sexual advances of the hospital chairman, Mo Yeon is picked to lead a medical team to staff a clinic in Urk! There, Mo Yeon unexpectedly reconnects with Si Jin. \"Descendants of the Sun\" is a 2016 South Korean drama series directed by Lee Eung Bok.

But until now, nobody has undertaken a comprehensive look at super-orgasmic women – women who can experience over a hundred orgasms in any one sexual encounter. A new study by Canada’s prestigious McGill University, for the first time reveals statistics and testimonies from over 450 super-orgasmic women. Some of them can experience 10 orgasms - while others come hundreds of times, experiencing hours of pleasure. They vary in age and background, but have one thing in common: they are all still a mystery to scientists, as what actually happens to them has never been studied. But that’s all about to change. A group of super-orgasmic women who took part in the Canadian study are taking it to the next stage. They will now go into the laboratory and meet the best sex scientists in the world. The aim is to reveal if the orgasms are all in their heads or can we prove and somehow measure that this endless chain of pleasure is really happening? By deploying fMRI (functional magnetic resonance imaging) scans, scientists will be monitoring changes in blood flow to the brain, looking at which parts are most active and shedding light on what these women feel during orgasm. Past fMRI studies about single orgasms have seen scientists disagree – but what will this new research reveal and will we be any closer to understanding why some women are super-orgasmic?","duration":"","imdbScore":"N/A"},{"title":"New Tricks","href":"https://www.hulu.com/series/new-tricks-1ec06883-a771-455e-8646-ea97185ba570","subgenres":["Comedy","Crime","Drama","International","Mystery"],"id":"new-tricks-1ec06883-a771-455e-8646-ea97185ba570","year":"2006","rating":"TV14","description":"A team of retired detectives with over 80 years service between them and very distinct personalities is recruited to re-examine unsolved crimes.

Known for living up to their name, the band partied so long and so hard that even Keith Richards thought they needed to slow things down. The Heathens were on the brink of becoming famous for their kickass live shows and the release of their highly anticipated first album. Until they broke up. The same day the album dropped. Because lead guitarist Flash (John Corbett) found Johnny in bed with his wife. So the band became legendary for all the wrong reasons - like self-destructing sooner than any group in rock-n-roll history. 25 years later, the only thing bigger than Johnny’s ego is his prostate. The drugs he really needs now aren’t cocaine and marijuana – they’re Crestor, Cymbalta and Cialis. He’s out of work, out of money and out of show business options. That’s when a massively talented young singer named Gigi (Elizabeth Gillies) shows up - with a burning desire to be famous, a throwback appreciation for The Heathens’ only album, and a stack of cash big enough to bring the whole band back into the studio. Only this time, SHE’S the lead singer and Johnny’s just a behind-the-scenes songwriter. John Ales, Bobby Kelly and Elaine Hendrix round out the rest of this dysfunctional rock and roll family. The race is on to see who gets famous first - and for what reason.

But until now, nobody has undertaken a comprehensive look at super-orgasmic women – women who can experience over a hundred orgasms in any one sexual encounter. A new study by Canada’s prestigious McGill University, for the first time reveals statistics and testimonies from over 450 super-orgasmic women. Some of them can experience 10 orgasms - while others come hundreds of times, experiencing hours of pleasure. They vary in age and background, but have one thing in common: they are all still a mystery to scientists, as what actually happens to them has never been studied. But that’s all about to change. A group of super-orgasmic women who took part in the Canadian study are taking it to the next stage. They will now go into the laboratory and meet the best sex scientists in the world. The aim is to reveal if the orgasms are all in their heads or can we prove and somehow measure that this endless chain of pleasure is really happening? By deploying fMRI (functional magnetic resonance imaging) scans, scientists will be monitoring changes in blood flow to the brain, looking at which parts are most active and shedding light on what these women feel during orgasm. Past fMRI studies about single orgasms have seen scientists disagree – but what will this new research reveal and will we be any closer to understanding why some women are super-orgasmic?","duration":"","imdbScore":"N/A"},{"title":"Obsessed (WIRED)","href":"https://www.hulu.com/series/obsessed-wired-c29aabab-181d-49d7-a971-e88c5cc7e787","subgenres":["Documentaries","Lifestyle & Culture","Science & Technology"],"id":"obsessed-wired-c29aabab-181d-49d7-a971-e88c5cc7e787","year":"2018","rating":"?","description":"Whether it’s re-creating detailed movie sets or building meticulous models of planes out of cardboard, some people’s passions are more than just a hobby. \"Obsessed\" highlights what happens when people live out those passions to the fullest.","duration":"","imdbScore":"N/A"},{"title":"Out There with Jack Randall","href":"https://www.hulu.com/series/out-there-with-jack-randall-6354c80f-366e-424a-aa87-e3560e083b8a","subgenres":["Reality","Science & Technology"],"id":"out-there-with-jack-randall-6354c80f-366e-424a-aa87-e3560e083b8a","year":"2019","rating":"TV14","description":"Jack ventures into the remote Northern Territory in Australia where he dives into crocodile-infested swamps, reaches into giant lizards' burrows and crawls through dark, cramped caves to find six dangerous pythons.","duration":"","imdbScore":"6.8"},{"title":"Puppies vs. the World","href":"https://www.hulu.com/series/puppies-vs-the-world-a33796ef-765d-4660-98bf-54326d9d75ca","subgenres":["Documentaries","Science & Technology"],"id":"puppies-vs-the-world-a33796ef-765d-4660-98bf-54326d9d75ca","year":"2017","rating":"TVPG","description":"For a puppy, it’s a big, brand-new world out there, full of obstacles, setbacks and amazing new experiences.

Kirk a century earlier, and, accordingly, it carries a larger crew complement: 1,012 men, women…and, surprisingly, children.  This era’s Starfleet Command believes that men and women are more likely to sign up for long-term exploratory missions if they think of their ship as home. Thus, Picard’s crew enjoys many of the comforts they’d have otherwise left behind, including a wide variety of recreational opportunities, “replicated” food dishes to suit every palate, and quarters large enough to share with spouses and offspring. There are schools for the children and a bar (stocked with synthetic alcohol, or synthehol) where the adults can unwind.

Known for living up to their name, the band partied so long and so hard that even Keith Richards thought they needed to slow things down. The Heathens were on the brink of becoming famous for their kickass live shows and the release of their highly anticipated first album. Until they broke up. The same day the album dropped. Because lead guitarist Flash (John Corbett) found Johnny in bed with his wife. So the band became legendary for all the wrong reasons - like self-destructing sooner than any group in rock-n-roll history. 25 years later, the only thing bigger than Johnny’s ego is his prostate. The drugs he really needs now aren’t cocaine and marijuana – they’re Crestor, Cymbalta and Cialis. He’s out of work, out of money and out of show business options. That’s when a massively talented young singer named Gigi (Elizabeth Gillies) shows up - with a burning desire to be famous, a throwback appreciation for The Heathens’ only album, and a stack of cash big enough to bring the whole band back into the studio.

They stand out because of the rare balance between lethal hardware and people skills: pure muscle and pure intuition. They’re the envy of law enforcement everywhere. The stakes are always high in Flashpoint – only here, the lives of the men and women on the team are also always on the line. That’s the nature of the job. The SRU may be heroes, but they are also human. At the end of the day, they each go home haunted by what they’ve seen, by what they’ve had to do – pursued by new demons which they cram into already bulging closets. They lock down emotion and they second-guess decisions made in the heat of the moment. These individuals are constant witnesses to the extremes of human distress. Not everyone is cut out for this. If you’re a cop, you’re three times more likely to kill yourself than to be killed by a bad guy.","duration":"","imdbScore":"7.7"},{"title":"Good Behavior","href":"https://www.hulu.com/series/good-behavior-34ecde63-ad36-4d1a-97c8-9d5b75f758d8","subgenres":["Drama","Thriller"],"id":"good-behavior-34ecde63-ad36-4d1a-97c8-9d5b75f758d8","year":"2017","rating":"TVMA","description":"Letty Raines is a thief and con artist whose life is always one wrong turn, one bad decision, from implosion.

Yossarian, a bombardier, whose frantic obsession every time he goes up on a mission is “to come down alive”. His odds of success at such a simple aim keep getting worse because Colonel Cathcart keeps raising the number of missions the men have to fly. More than the retreating Germans, the real enemy for Yossarian and his rag-tag bunch of friends is the bureaucracy of the military, inverting logic at every turn. The pinnacle of this is Catch-22, a military by-law which states that if you fly your missions, you’re crazy, and don’t have to fly them; all you have to do is ask. But if you ask not to, then you’re sane, and so you have to fly them.","duration":"","imdbScore":"7.8"},{"title":"Dollface","href":"https://www.hulu.com/series/dollface-5e0e449e-6bc7-4b29-8255-bc5a5f5a9f0d","subgenres":["Comedy","Audio Description"],"id":"dollface-5e0e449e-6bc7-4b29-8255-bc5a5f5a9f0d","year":"2019","rating":"TVMA","description":"Kat Dennings stars as a young woman who, after being dumped by her longtime boyfriend, must deal with her own imagination when she literally and metaphorically re-enters the world of women, in order to rekindle the female friendships she left behind.

After Tuko is collected, the Alien's ship malfunctions and sends it on a crash course with the farm where Julia (Kamaia Fairburn), Johnny (Edison Grant), Tabby (Michela Luci) and Finn (Cale Thomas Ferrin) live with their foster dad, Mr. Leopold (Neil Crone). Before crashing, the Alien releases all of its cosmic collection into the fields and wilderness surrounding the property.
