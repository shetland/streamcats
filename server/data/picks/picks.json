Nandor the Relentless, Nadja, and Laszlo (<i>Vampire tricked in Steam Room</i>) star as roommates along with the ‘energy vampire’ Colin Robinson and their oft mistreated human servant Guillermo.</p>From the brilliant comic mind of Jemaine Clement (Flight of the Conchords), this superb owl of writing and acting is sure to hypnotize.

The excellent cast delivers multidimensional characters that are as flawed as they are darkly humorous, and the storytelling is fast, offbeat, and fresh. From the creators of Glee (Ian Brennan, Brad Falchuk, and Ryan Murphy), this high school drama is definitely worth casting your vote for.",

Yous gots to watch it.</p>The jokes fly as fast as the fists in Letterkenny so it’s best to keep the subtitles on so you can “figure it out”. Pitter Patter!",
