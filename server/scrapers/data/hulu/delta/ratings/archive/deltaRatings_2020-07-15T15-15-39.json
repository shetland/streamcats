Foremost among them is MIKE LAWSON (Mark-Paul Gosselaar, “Franklin & Bash,” “NYPD Blue”), the team’s ruggedly handsome star catcher. There’s instant chemistry between them, although neither dares admit it. After all, Mike is captain of the team and a few of his players don’t even want Ginny on the field. One of the players watching Ginny’s back is center fielder BLIP SANDERS (Mo McRae, “Sons of Anarchy”), an old friend from the minor leagues and his wife EVELYN (Meagan Holder, “You Again,” “Bring it On: Fight to the Finish”).\n\nGuiding her is her agent/confidante, AMELIA SLATER (Ali Larter, “Legends,” “Heroes”). Amelia saw Ginny’s star potential early on and left her previous job as a Hollywood publicist to concentrate on the young phenom, bringing along her young assistant ELIOT (Tim Jo, “The Neighbors”).\n\nAlthough groomed for this moment by her demanding father, BILL BAKER (guest star Michael Beach, “Sons of Anarchy”), the end of Ginny’s improbable journey is the beginning of an almost impossible one: representing her gender as she embarks on a successful baseball career under the glare of the white-hot media spotlight.","starring":"","imdbScore":"7.4","imdbHref":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5500158/"},{"title":"Portrait of a Lady on Fire.","href":"https://www.hulu.com/movie/portrait-of-a-lady-on-fire-d514447d-1954-4bf8-8164-fa3d6fdfe73f","id":"portrait-of-a-lady-on-fire-d514447d-1954-4bf8-8164-fa3d6fdfe73f","year":"2019","rating":"R","description":"In 18th century France a young painter, Marianne (Noémie Merlant), is commissioned to do the wedding portrait of Héloïse (Adèle Haenel).
