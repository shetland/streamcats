Alone in a Paris theater after a long day of auditioning actresses for his new play, writer-director Thomas (Mathieu Amalric) complains that no actress he's seen has what it takes to play the lead female character: a woman who enters into an agreement with her male counterpart to dominate him as her slave. Thomas is about to leave the theater when actress Vanda (Emmanuelle Seigner) bursts in, a whirlwind of erratic - and, it turns out, erotic - energy. At first she seems to embody everything Thomas has been lamenting. She is pushy, foul-mouthed, desperate and ill-prepared - or so it seems. When Thomas finally, reluctantly, agrees to let her try out for the part, he is stunned and captivated by her transformation. Not only is Vanda a perfect fit (even sharing the character's name), but she apparently has researched the role exhaustively, learned her lines by heart and even bought her own props. The likeness proves to be much more than skin-deep. As the extended \"audition\" builds momentum, Thomas moves from attraction to obsession until, with Vanda taking an ever more dominant role, the balance of power shifts completely.","duration":"","imdbScore":"7.2"},{"title":"Veronica Mars","href":"https://www.hulu.com/movie/veronica-mars-5b7f9916-1a7d-4251-a8b4-c392d9e1dcd3","subgenres":["Comedy","Drama","Mystery"],"id":"veronica-mars-5b7f9916-1a7d-4251-a8b4-c392d9e1dcd3","year":"2014","rating":"PG-13","description":"On the eve of her law-school graduation, Veronica turns amateur sleuth once again after ex-boyfriend, Logan, becomes a murder suspect.","duration":"","imdbScore":"8.3"},{"title":"A Very Brady Christmas","href":"https://www.hulu.com/movie/a-very-brady-christmas-8447e16e-ddf0-4caa-81b1-b2f73424b4eb","subgenres":["Comedy","Family"],"id":"a-very-brady-christmas-8447e16e-ddf0-4caa-81b1-b2f73424b4eb","year":"1988","rating":"TVPG","description":"Deck the halls with love and laughter as the Brady Bunch comes home for Christmas!

Painkillers give doctors tremendous power to relieve pain, a primary goal of any physician. But this power begets trouble when the same drugs can lead to addiction, abuse and death. The documentary traces Dr. Hurwitz's trial, detailing the events that lead to his arrest. Testimonies from witnesses in the case contradict one another - some revere him, while others condemn him. Taken together, their accounts reveal a portrait of a compassion yet flawed doctor. The film underscores the tension between every patient's right to pain relief and the lawful need for drug control. In 2016 prescription drugs kill more Americans than HIV or homicide, and more than heroin and cocaine combined. There could not be a more critical time to spark a discussion on this topic and call for careful though and action.","duration":"","imdbScore":"6.6"},{"title":"Dumb: The Story of Big Brother Magazine","href":"https://www.hulu.com/movie/dumb-the-story-of-big-brother-magazine-c25b4f59-194f-4eed-bc11-19d2d749520e","subgenres":["Documentaries","Audio Description"],"id":"dumb-the-story-of-big-brother-magazine-c25b4f59-194f-4eed-bc11-19d2d749520e","year":"2017","rating":"TVMA","description":"The history of the boundary-pushing, taboo-breaking, crassly-humorous Big Brother magazine, that spawned MTV's \"Jackass\" and a generation of skaters.","duration":"","imdbScore":"7.4"},{"title":"Dust 2 Glory","href":"https://www.hulu.com/movie/dust-2-glory-29ec07e0-2822-4aac-8a57-bc46c7ad4a80","subgenres":["Documentaries"],"id":"dust-2-glory-29ec07e0-2822-4aac-8a57-bc46c7ad4a80","year":"2017","rating":"","description":"Filmmaker Dana Brown explores the SCORE Baja 1000, the world's toughest, point-to-point desert race.","duration":"","imdbScore":"5.7"},{"title":"Eating Animals","href":"https://www.hulu.com/movie/eating-animals-db898262-e4f7-40fe-bbb4-23b9bff0348b","subgenres":["Documentaries"],"id":"eating-animals-db898262-e4f7-40fe-bbb4-23b9bff0348b","year":"2017","rating":"","description":"What's on your plate?

Alone in a Paris theater after a long day of auditioning actresses for his new play, writer-director Thomas (Mathieu Amalric) complains that no actress he's seen has what it takes to play the lead female character: a woman who enters into an agreement with her male counterpart to dominate him as her slave. Thomas is about to leave the theater when actress Vanda (Emmanuelle Seigner) bursts in, a whirlwind of erratic - and, it turns out, erotic - energy. At first she seems to embody everything Thomas has been lamenting. She is pushy, foul-mouthed, desperate and ill-prepared - or so it seems. When Thomas finally, reluctantly, agrees to let her try out for the part, he is stunned and captivated by her transformation. Not only is Vanda a perfect fit (even sharing the character's name), but she apparently has researched the role exhaustively, learned her lines by heart and even bought her own props. The likeness proves to be much more than skin-deep. As the extended \"audition\" builds momentum, Thomas moves from attraction to obsession until, with Vanda taking an ever more dominant role, the balance of power shifts completely.","duration":"","imdbScore":"7.2"},{"title":"Veronica Mars","href":"https://www.hulu.com/movie/veronica-mars-5b7f9916-1a7d-4251-a8b4-c392d9e1dcd3","subgenres":["Comedy","Drama","Mystery"],"id":"veronica-mars-5b7f9916-1a7d-4251-a8b4-c392d9e1dcd3","year":"2014","rating":"PG-13","description":"On the eve of her law-school graduation, Veronica turns amateur sleuth once again after ex-boyfriend, Logan, becomes a murder suspect.","duration":"","imdbScore":"8.3"},{"title":"Vice","href":"https://www.hulu.com/movie/vice-9e2359f5-c334-43e2-b9cc-c4beeea666a2","subgenres":["Comedy","Drama"],"id":"vice-9e2359f5-c334-43e2-b9cc-c4beeea666a2","year":"2018","rating":"R","description":"The untold true story of Vice President Dick Cheney, a Washington insider who changed the course of history.","duration":"","imdbScore":"7.2"},{"title":"The Villainess","href":"https://www.hulu.com/movie/the-villainess-9b6a6ba5-ace0-4925-a47c-009849053ef7","subgenres":["Action","Drama","International"],"id":"the-villainess-9b6a6ba5-ace0-4925-a47c-009849053ef7","year":"2017","rating":"","description":"Bloody revenge is at the heart of this stylish action-thriller that doses the classic femme fatale story with a shot of adrenaline as it follows a former assassin who will stop at nothing to cut ties to her past.","duration":"","imdbScore":"6.7"},{"title":"Villains","href":"https://www.hulu.com/movie/villains-ac3b54d9-7008-4cb3-b808-3fd137016812","subgenres":["Comedy","Drama"],"id":"villains-ac3b54d9-7008-4cb3-b808-3fd137016812","year":"2019","rating":"R","description":"A pair of amateur criminals break into a suburban home and stumble upon a dark secret that two sadistic homeowners will do anything to keep from getting out.","duration":"","imdbScore":"6.2"},{"title":"Vincere","href":"https://www.hulu.com/movie/vincere-3addea18-8fcc-45f9-ba40-514d8479f935","subgenres":["Drama","Romance"],"id":"vincere-3addea18-8fcc-45f9-ba40-514d8479f935","year":"2009","rating":"TVMA","description":"In this provocative, erotic romance, Benito Mussolini's feisty mistress will stop at nothing to be in the arms of her powerful lover.","duration":"","imdbScore":"6.9"},{"title":"Vita & Virginia","href":"https://www.hulu.com/movie/vita-virginia-3b941090-e95a-4944-8f2c-d1e7918d404e","subgenres":["Drama","LGBTQ+","Romance"],"id":"vita-virginia-3b941090-e95a-4944-8f2c-d1e7918d404e","year":"2019","rating":"","description":"The seductive true story of Virginia Woolf's love affair with socialite Vita Sackville-West, who inspired one of Woolf's greatest works of literature.","duration":"","imdbScore":"5.6"},{"title":"Vox Lux","href":"https://www.hulu.com/movie/vox-lux-07fb7449-263b-4620-abe2-bcb2d853e579","subgenres":["Drama","Music"],"id":"vox-lux-07fb7449-263b-4620-abe2-bcb2d853e579","year":"2018","rating":"R","description":"An unusual set of circumstances brings unexpected success to a pop star (Natalie Portman).","duration":"","imdbScore":"5.9"},{"title":"Waiting to Exhale","href":"https://www.hulu.com/movie/waiting-to-exhale-8654c4dc-67ba-4754-af21-d7de6206949c","subgenres":["Comedy","Drama","Romance"],"id":"waiting-to-exhale-8654c4dc-67ba-4754-af21-d7de6206949c","year":"1995","rating":"R","description":"Four successful African-American women endure the ups and downs of modern love in this witty, often hilarious film based on the best-selling novel by Terry McMillan.","duration":"","imdbScore":"5.9"},{"title":"Walk Away Renee","href":"https://www.hulu.com/movie/walk-away-renee-9cbd4365-084d-4b1e-b624-c9edd4a27ac9","subgenres":["Documentaries","Drama"],"id":"walk-away-renee-9cbd4365-084d-4b1e-b624-c9edd4a27ac9","year":"2011","rating":"TVMA","description":"A sweet and affecting film about filmmaker Jonathan Caouette's journey of self-discovery on a transformative road trip with his mother.","duration":"","imdbScore":"6.5"},{"title":"Walking With the Enemy","href":"https://www.hulu.com/movie/walking-with-the-enemy-ab131cb8-9a77-4635-9d35-3df7d15e5631","subgenres":["Action","Drama","History"],"id":"walking-with-the-enemy-ab131cb8-9a77-4635-9d35-3df7d15e5631","year":"2013","rating":"PG-13","description":"During World War II, a young Hungarian (Jonas Armstrong) disguises himself as a Nazi officer to save his family and thousands of his countrymen from the death camps.
