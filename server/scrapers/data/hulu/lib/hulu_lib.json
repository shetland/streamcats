Alone in a Paris theater after a long day of auditioning actresses for his new play, writer-director Thomas (Mathieu Amalric) complains that no actress he's seen has what it takes to play the lead female character: a woman who enters into an agreement with her male counterpart to dominate him as her slave. Thomas is about to leave the theater when actress Vanda (Emmanuelle Seigner) bursts in, a whirlwind of erratic - and, it turns out, erotic - energy. At first she seems to embody everything Thomas has been lamenting. She is pushy, foul-mouthed, desperate and ill-prepared - or so it seems. When Thomas finally, reluctantly, agrees to let her try out for the part, he is stunned and captivated by her transformation. Not only is Vanda a perfect fit (even sharing the character's name), but she apparently has researched the role exhaustively, learned her lines by heart and even bought her own props.

A symbol of youth, freedom, and rebellion, Blue Jeans leads us through fashion history, music, and subculture dreams, to the lost tradition of American manufacturing – exploring the responsibility of Americana in a globalized world of cultural exchange, transparency, and innovation.","starring":"","imdbScore":"7.3","imdbHref":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1597028/","subgenres":["Documentaries"]},"bogalusa-charm-ff0725eb-0edf-403a-b817-aecb78bb68bf":{"title":"Bogalusa Charm","href":"https://www.hulu.com/movie/bogalusa-charm-ff0725eb-0edf-403a-b817-aecb78bb68bf","id":"bogalusa-charm-ff0725eb-0edf-403a-b817-aecb78bb68bf","year":"2017","rating":"NR","description":"Through the lens of an anachronistic charm school that has existed for almost three decades in rural Louisiana, we explore a town confronted with contemporary issues of class and race.","starring":"","imdbScore":"7.6","imdbHref":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6281944/","subgenres":["Documentaries"]},"boom-for-real-the-late-teenage-years-of-jean-michel-basquiat-805be2fb-f0dc-4513-acf9-aa59cb831d6a":{"title":"Boom for Real: The Late Teenage Years of Jean-Michel Basquiat","href":"https://www.hulu.com/movie/boom-for-real-the-late-teenage-years-of-jean-michel-basquiat-805be2fb-f0dc-4513-acf9-aa59cb831d6a","id":"boom-for-real-the-late-teenage-years-of-jean-michel-basquiat-805be2fb-f0dc-4513-acf9-aa59cb831d6a","year":"2018","rating":"NR","description":"Follow Basquiat's life pre-fame and how New York City, the times, the people and the movements surrounding him formed the artist he became.","starring":"","imdbScore":"6.5","imdbHref":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7210348/","subgenres":["Documentaries"]},"the-brink-2019-810956bd-bd53-48f6-ad0b-28b85a7f7a66":{"title":"The Brink (2019)","href":"https://www.hulu.com/movie/the-brink-2019-810956bd-bd53-48f6-ad0b-28b85a7f7a66","id":"the-brink-2019-810956bd-bd53-48f6-ad0b-28b85a7f7a66","year":"2019","rating":"NR","description":"The Brink follows Steve Bannon leading up to the 2018 mid-term elections in the United States.

Chris Burden guaranteed his place in art history in the 1970s with a series of often dangerous and at times stomach-churning performances. After having himself shot in Santa Ana, confined to a locker for five days in Irvine and crucified on the back of a VW bug in Venice, Burden reinvented himself as the creator of truly mesmerizing installations and sculptures, from a suspended gigantic flywheel that seemingly spins on its own to an assemblage of illuminated, antique streetlights outside the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, Urban Light (2008), which has become one of Los Angeles’ most photographed and iconic symbols. In Burden, Timothy Marrinan and Richard Dewey look at the artist’s work and private life with an innovative mix of still-potent videos of his 70s performances, personal films and audio recordings, latter day footage at his Topanga Canyon studio and comments from friends, fellow students, colleagues and critics, all peppered with Burden’s thoughts and musings from throughout the years.","starring":"","imdbScore":"6.2","imdbHref":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5314450/","subgenres":["Documentaries"]},"burn-5645e8b9-b95f-4b3f-af7e-bbd60273a502":{"title":"Burn","href":"https://www.hulu.com/movie/burn-5645e8b9-b95f-4b3f-af7e-bbd60273a502","id":"burn-5645e8b9-b95f-4b3f-af7e-bbd60273a502","year":"2012","rating":"NR","description":"An action-packed documentary about Detroit told through the eyes of firefighters charged with the thankless task of saving a city that many have written off as dead.","starring":"","imdbScore":"7.5","imdbHref":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1781784/","subgenres":["Documentaries"]},"the-cage-fighter-759b6dcd-a284-48ba-b89a-b965969ee5bb":{"title":"The Cage Fighter","href":"https://www.hulu.com/movie/the-cage-fighter-759b6dcd-a284-48ba-b89a-b965969ee5bb","id":"the-cage-fighter-759b6dcd-a284-48ba-b89a-b965969ee5bb","year":"2017","rating":"NR","description":"A mixed martial arts competitor risks everything—his family, his marriage, even his life—to keep fighting in this riveting, true-life tale of resilience.","starring":"","imdbScore":"5.9","imdbHref":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6436888/","subgenres":["Documentaries","Drama","Sports"]},"a-cam-life-b9a69bd3-8ae5-41c8-8260-f505632826bb":{"title":"A Cam Life","href":"https://www.hulu.com/movie/a-cam-life-b9a69bd3-8ae5-41c8-8260-f505632826bb","id":"a-cam-life-b9a69bd3-8ae5-41c8-8260-f505632826bb","year":"2018","rating":"NR","description":"An undaunted look into the cam business from performers and clients to website and studio owners.","starring":"","imdbScore":"4.8","imdbHref":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5657764/","subgenres":["Documentaries"]},"cannabis-evolution-a25110e8-30bb-4fa9-aea5-b225580643a8":{"title":"Cannabis Evolution","href":"https://www.hulu.com/movie/cannabis-evolution-a25110e8-30bb-4fa9-aea5-b225580643a8","id":"cannabis-evolution-a25110e8-30bb-4fa9-aea5-b225580643a8","year":"2019","rating":"NR","description":"Science has confirmed marijuana has the potential to treat physical and mental conditions, from cancer to PTSD.

Painkillers give doctors tremendous power to relieve pain, a primary goal of any physician. But this power begets trouble when the same drugs can lead to addiction, abuse and death. The documentary traces Dr. Hurwitz's trial, detailing the events that lead to his arrest. Testimonies from witnesses in the case contradict one another - some revere him, while others condemn him. Taken together, their accounts reveal a portrait of a compassion yet flawed doctor. The film underscores the tension between every patient's right to pain relief and the lawful need for drug control. In 2016 prescription drugs kill more Americans than HIV or homicide, and more than heroin and cocaine combined. There could not be a more critical time to spark a discussion on this topic and call for careful though and action.","starring":"","imdbScore":"6.6","imdbHref":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5192362/","subgenres":["Documentaries"]},"dumb-the-story-of-big-brother-magazine-c25b4f59-194f-4eed-bc11-19d2d749520e":{"title":"Dumb: The Story of Big Brother Magazine","href":"https://www.hulu.com/movie/dumb-the-story-of-big-brother-magazine-c25b4f59-194f-4eed-bc11-19d2d749520e","id":"dumb-the-story-of-big-brother-magazine-c25b4f59-194f-4eed-bc11-19d2d749520e","year":"2017","rating":"TVMA","description":"The history of the boundary-pushing, taboo-breaking, crassly-humorous Big Brother magazine, that spawned MTV's \"Jackass\" and a generation of skaters.","starring":"","imdbScore":"7.2","imdbHref":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6794450/","subgenres":["Documentaries","Audio Description"]},"dust-2-glory-29ec07e0-2822-4aac-8a57-bc46c7ad4a80":{"title":"Dust 2 Glory","href":"https://www.hulu.com/movie/dust-2-glory-29ec07e0-2822-4aac-8a57-bc46c7ad4a80","id":"dust-2-glory-29ec07e0-2822-4aac-8a57-bc46c7ad4a80","year":"2017","rating":"NR","description":"Filmmaker Dana Brown explores the SCORE Baja 1000, the world's toughest, point-to-point desert race.","starring":"","imdbScore":"6.2","imdbHref":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8526506/","subgenres":["Documentaries"]},"eating-animals-db898262-e4f7-40fe-bbb4-23b9bff0348b":{"title":"Eating Animals","href":"https://www.hulu.com/movie/eating-animals-db898262-e4f7-40fe-bbb4-23b9bff0348b","id":"eating-animals-db898262-e4f7-40fe-bbb4-23b9bff0348b","year":"2017","rating":"NR","description":"What's on your plate?

Stanley Milgram (Peter Sarsgaard) designs a psychology experiment that remains relevant to this day, in which people think they’re delivering painful electric shocks to an affable stranger (Jim Gaffigan) strapped into a chair in another room. Disregarding his pleas for mercy, the majority of subjects do not stop the experiment, administering what they think are near-fatal electric shots, simply because they’ve been told to.

High risk is their business and life-and-death stakes are their world. The SRU team is also unique; they rescue hostages, bust gangs, defuse bombs, climb buildings, see through walls and talk down suicidal teens. It takes years on the street, intense physical conditioning and elite marksmanship to qualify for the SRU. They have to prove that they’re at the top of their game on a daily basis because if they’re not, there are hundreds of others willing to step in and take their place. The team uses state-of-the-art equipment – sniper rifles, snake-cameras, robots, flash-bangs, night-vision and tasers. But beyond all of the cool gadgetry, the most important weapons in their arsenal are human intuition, a gift for words and their ability to read emotion. Each team member is uniquely trained in negotiating, profiling and getting inside a subject’s head. They stand out because of the rare balance between lethal hardware and people skills: pure muscle and pure intuition. They’re the envy of law enforcement everywhere. The stakes are always high in Flashpoint – only here, the lives of the men and women on the team are also always on the line. That’s the nature of the job. The SRU may be heroes, but they are also human. At the end of the day, they each go home haunted by what they’ve seen, by what they’ve had to do – pursued by new demons which they cram into already bulging closets. They lock down emotion and they second-guess decisions made in the heat of the moment. These individuals are constant witnesses to the extremes of human distress. Not everyone is cut out for this. If you’re a cop, you’re three times more likely to kill yourself than to be killed by a bad guy.","starring":"","imdbScore":"7.7","imdbHref":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1059475/?ref_=tt_ov_inf","subgenres":["Action","Crime","Drama","Thriller"]},"full-metal-panic-348dc05a-07e2-40e7-8e47-f47067a61e4b":{"title":"Full Metal Panic!","href":"https://www.hulu.com/series/full-metal-panic-348dc05a-07e2-40e7-8e47-f47067a61e4b","id":"full-metal-panic-348dc05a-07e2-40e7-8e47-f47067a61e4b","year":"2002","rating":"TVPG","description":"Sousuke Sagara, a seventeen year old military specialist working for the secret organization MITHRIL, has been assigned to protect the latest \"Whispered\" candidate Kaname Chidori.

Kirk a century earlier, and, accordingly, it carries a larger crew complement: 1,012 men, women…and, surprisingly, children.  This era’s Starfleet Command believes that men and women are more likely to sign up for long-term exploratory missions if they think of their ship as home. Thus, Picard’s crew enjoys many of the comforts they’d have otherwise left behind, including a wide variety of recreational opportunities, “replicated” food dishes to suit every palate, and quarters large enough to share with spouses and offspring. There are schools for the children and a bar (stocked with synthetic alcohol, or synthehol) where the adults can unwind. However, the ongoing mission—no longer limited to a mere five years—remains virtually the same as it was during Kirk’s time: to seek out new life and new civilizations, and to boldly go where no one has gone before.","starring":"","imdbScore":"8.6","imdbHref":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0092455/","subgenres":["Action","Adventure","Classics","Drama","Family","Science Fiction"]},"star-trek-the-original-series-26f1ae35-0abd-4828-8786-7752ae7998d5":{"title":"Star Trek: The Original Series","href":"https://www.hulu.com/series/star-trek-the-original-series-26f1ae35-0abd-4828-8786-7752ae7998d5","id":"star-trek-the-original-series-26f1ae35-0abd-4828-8786-7752ae7998d5","year":"1966","rating":"TVPG","description":"The 23rd century adventures of Captain James T.

The program’s depiction of a “typical” mid-century, middle-class, Midwestern American family is fondly remembered by many of us who grew up watching the show and rather enviously thinking: “Oh. So this is what happens in all the other houses.” \n\nMargaret Anderson (Jane Wyatt) charmed us as the levelheaded domestic diva who stood faithfully behind the strong and benevolent father. Their three children—sophisticated teen Betty (Elinor Donahue), chronically befuddled 14-year-old brother “Bud” (Billy Gray) and precocious little sister Kathy (Lauren Chapin)—faced the challenges of growing up right alongside of us. And in episode after episode, Jim and Margaret treated their children’s youthful transgressions with authority, empathy and wisdom. By the end of each half hour, we’d all learned our lesson. \n\nJoin Jim and Margaret and “Princess,” “Bud” and “Kitten” in their very first year as everyone’s favorite ’50s family in Father Knows Best. \"","starring":"","imdbScore":"7.4","imdbHref":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0046600/","subgenres":["Comedy","Family","Sitcom"]},"flophouse-d21c0cff-dff8-48b7-a6d2-92cc2add20dd":{"title":"Flophouse","href":"https://www.hulu.com/series/flophouse-d21c0cff-dff8-48b7-a6d2-92cc2add20dd","id":"flophouse-d21c0cff-dff8-48b7-a6d2-92cc2add20dd","year":"2016","rating":"TV14","description":"Up-and-coming comedians live together while working toward their dreams of success.","starring":"","imdbScore":"5.4","imdbHref":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5513442/","subgenres":["Comedy","Reality","Stand Up"]},"four-weddings-and-a-funeral-2e17b3b3-cadf-41ee-b8a2-59fe64c17f67":{"title":"Four Weddings and a Funeral","href":"https://www.hulu.com/series/four-weddings-and-a-funeral-2e17b3b3-cadf-41ee-b8a2-59fe64c17f67","id":"four-weddings-and-a-funeral-2e17b3b3-cadf-41ee-b8a2-59fe64c17f67","year":"2019","rating":"TVMA","description":"Maya, the young communications director for a New York senatorial campaign, receives a wedding invitation from her college schoolmate now living in London.

You just need to have friends that you hate. FXX's ensemble comedy follows a group of old friends in a fantasy football league who care deeply about one another - so deeply that they use every opportunity to make each other's lives miserable. The League was created by the husband-and-wife team of Jeff Schaffer (Curb Your Enthusiasm, Seinfeld) and Jackie Marcus Schaffer (Disturbia, Eurotrip) who serve as executive producers and directors. The League features an ensemble cast of rising actors/comedians. Mark Duplass (Humpday) plays \"Pete,\" the perennial league champ who is struggling to become an adult. Stephen Rannazzisi (Paul Blart: Mall Cop) is \"Kevin,\" a happily married father and commissioner of the league. Nick Kroll (Get Him to the Greek) plays \"Ruxin,\" who believes he is the smartest of the group but can't figure out how exactly the other guys are screwing him over. \"Andre,\" played by Paul Scheer (Human Giant), has continued to be the punching bag of the group since their high school days - a fact that hasn't changed despite the fact he is now a successful plastic surgeon. Jon Lajoie is \"Taco,\" Kevin's little brother, a part-time musician and full-time stoner with little interest in fantasy other than hanging with his buddies (whom he struggles to remember). Katie Aselton (The Freebie) plays \"Jenny,\" Kevin's wife and his better half - especially when it comes to Fantasy Football.

Set in Chicago, The Loop is the story of Sam (Bret Harrison), the youngest executive at the corporate headquarters of a major airline, and the first of his friends to get a real job. He must find a way to straddle his serious career and the serious social demands of his three roommates: Sully (Eric Christian Olsen), is Sam's older and rowdier brother, whose casual attempts to hold down a series of odd jobs are eclipsed by his attempts to land women. Roommate Piper (Amanda Loncar) is a medical student, Sam's college pal and -- unbeknownst to her -- his longtime crush. And roommate Lizzy (Sarah Mason), who tends bar at their local hangout, is oblivious to the fact that everything always goes her way because she's so smoking hot. As Sam strives to meet the relentless demands of his boss Russ (Philip Baker Hall), dodge the nonstop advances of his colleague Meryl (Mimi Rogers), manage his overqualified and somewhat bitter secretary Darcy (Joy Osmanski), and turn his best-friendship with Piper into romance, he is, by turns, ambitious, exhausted and inspired. Moreover, he is a hero for everyone who has ever tried to work hard and play hard at the same time.","starring":"","imdbScore":"7.4","imdbHref":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0460655/","subgenres":["Comedy","Sitcom"]},"mash-ae94231d-0f04-482a-b9ee-9911e339e3ed":{"title":"M*A*S*H","href":"https://www.hulu.com/series/mash-ae94231d-0f04-482a-b9ee-9911e339e3ed","id":"mash-ae94231d-0f04-482a-b9ee-9911e339e3ed","year":"1972","rating":"TVPG","description":"A fast-paced and fun-filled series relating the antics of a mobile army surgical hospital crew during the Korean war.

The show also features Russ and Lina's friend AJ (Brett Gelman), who is recently divorced and pretending he's over his wife, and their other friend Jess (Jenny Slate), who is married to a much older man who can't keep up with her.\nMarried was created by Andrew Gurland (The Virginity Hit, Mail Order Wife), who wrote and directed the pilot script and serves as Executive Producer/Showrunner, alongside Executive Producers Paul Young and Peter Principato.

Known for living up to their name, the band partied so long and so hard that even Keith Richards thought they needed to slow things down. The Heathens were on the brink of becoming famous for their kickass live shows and the release of their highly anticipated first album. Until they broke up. The same day the album dropped. Because lead guitarist Flash (John Corbett) found Johnny in bed with his wife. So the band became legendary for all the wrong reasons - like self-destructing sooner than any group in rock-n-roll history. 25 years later, the only thing bigger than Johnny’s ego is his prostate. The drugs he really needs now aren’t cocaine and marijuana – they’re Crestor, Cymbalta and Cialis. He’s out of work, out of money and out of show business options. That’s when a massively talented young singer named Gigi (Elizabeth Gillies) shows up - with a burning desire to be famous, a throwback appreciation for The Heathens’ only album, and a stack of cash big enough to bring the whole band back into the studio. Only this time, SHE’S the lead singer and Johnny’s just a behind-the-scenes songwriter. John Ales, Bobby Kelly and Elaine Hendrix round out the rest of this dysfunctional rock and roll family. The race is on to see who gets famous first - and for what reason.  An FX Original Series.","starring":"","imdbScore":"7.1","imdbHref":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3594982/","subgenres":["Comedy","Music","Sitcom"]},"shameless-uk-4c725adf-124e-4359-a262-9a5d3d1e61dc":{"title":"Shameless (UK)","href":"https://www.hulu.com/series/shameless-uk-4c725adf-124e-4359-a262-9a5d3d1e61dc","id":"shameless-uk-4c725adf-124e-4359-a262-9a5d3d1e61dc","year":"2004","rating":"TV14","description":"Meet the Gallagher family as they experience life on the edge in a blur of sexual adventures, triumphs, love, scams and petty crime on a Manchester housing estate.

But until now, nobody has undertaken a comprehensive look at super-orgasmic women – women who can experience over a hundred orgasms in any one sexual encounter. A new study by Canada’s prestigious McGill University, for the first time reveals statistics and testimonies from over 450 super-orgasmic women. Some of them can experience 10 orgasms - while others come hundreds of times, experiencing hours of pleasure. They vary in age and background, but have one thing in common: they are all still a mystery to scientists, as what actually happens to them has never been studied. But that’s all about to change. A group of super-orgasmic women who took part in the Canadian study are taking it to the next stage. They will now go into the laboratory and meet the best sex scientists in the world. The aim is to reveal if the orgasms are all in their heads or can we prove and somehow measure that this endless chain of pleasure is really happening? By deploying fMRI (functional magnetic resonance imaging) scans, scientists will be monitoring changes in blood flow to the brain, looking at which parts are most active and shedding light on what these women feel during orgasm. Past fMRI studies about single orgasms have seen scientists disagree – but what will this new research reveal and will we be any closer to understanding why some women are super-orgasmic?","starring":"","imdbScore":"N/A","imdbHref":"","subgenres":["Documentaries","International","News","Science & Technology"]},"nightwatch-f20f68f8-843c-4d68-875e-5fa05127bbf9":{"title":"Nightwatch","href":"https://www.hulu.com/series/nightwatch-f20f68f8-843c-4d68-875e-5fa05127bbf9","id":"nightwatch-f20f68f8-843c-4d68-875e-5fa05127bbf9","year":"2015","rating":"TV14","description":"\"Nightwatch\" follows the dangerous stretch of time (between 9pm until 3am) when emergency responders deal with the busiest shift of the day and the most unnerving cases.","starring":"","imdbScore":"8.9","imdbHref":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4287464/","subgenres":["Documentaries","Drama","Mystery","Reality"]},"nightwatch-nation-76590c4b-c18d-4f49-ae4c-4da19e01997d":{"title":"Nightwatch Nation","href":"https://www.hulu.com/series/nightwatch-nation-76590c4b-c18d-4f49-ae4c-4da19e01997d","id":"nightwatch-nation-76590c4b-c18d-4f49-ae4c-4da19e01997d","year":"2018","rating":"TV14","description":"\"Nightwatch Nation,\" the new nonfiction series from executive producer Dick Wolf and 44 Blue Productions, follows EMTs in Yonkers, New York, Austin, Texas, Tucson, Arizona and Baton Rouge, Louisiana as these real-life heroes risk their lives to work the busiest and most unnerving shift of the day, the overnight.","starring":"","imdbScore":"8.6","imdbHref":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8732790/","subgenres":["Documentaries","Reality"]},"nostradamus-effect-554f5899-b2f2-4958-91cf-a1437569a9c3":{"title":"Nostradamus Effect","href":"https://www.hulu.com/series/nostradamus-effect-554f5899-b2f2-4958-91cf-a1437569a9c3","id":"nostradamus-effect-554f5899-b2f2-4958-91cf-a1437569a9c3","year":"2009","rating":"TV14","description":"How do real-life happenings correlate with a particular prophecy?

Bassam “Barry” Al Fayeed (Adam Rayner), the youngest son of a war-torn country’s controversial dictator, returns to his homeland after a self-imposed 20-year exile in America for his nephew’s wedding.  Upon his return, Barry is immediately thrown back into the familial and national politics of his youth.  As he braces himself to confront the stark realities of his father and older brother Jamal’s (Ashraf Barhom) harsh rule, Barry is unable and unwilling to make his all-American family understand his unease over returning home.  His wife, Molly (Jennifer Finnigan), struggling to comprehend her husband’s apprehension, uncovers a romantic history involving Leila (Moran Atias), Jamal’s beautiful wife.  Emma (Anne Winters), their 15-year-old daughter, adores her father and shares his disdain for the extravagances of her extended family.  Meanwhile, their son, 16-year-old Sammy (Noah Silver), revels in the lavish lifestyle their royal” status brings, but dangerously tests cultural divides with his poorly disguised interest in handsome family bodyguard Abdul (Mehdi Dehbi).  Barry’s only warm memory of his childhood, boyhood friend Fauzi (Fares Fares), wants nothing to do with him.  Fauzi is now a journalist, whose reports on the abuses of the Al Fayeed rule resulted in Fauzi's arrest and torture.  Barry must now confront the life he once fled.  With his father's health in decline, everyone – Jamal, their mother Amira (Alice Krige), their father's top advisor Yussef (Salim Daw), and even easygoing U.S. diplomat John Tucker (Justin Kirk) – expects him to assume a more active role in both the family and the regime.

The pranksters have a week to fulfill each episode’s prank challenge and capture it on video. They then vote on which of their peers performed best and each episode comes to an eye-watering climax (insert porno joke here) as the losers cop bizarre punishments while only the winner is spared.","starring":"","imdbScore":"6.2","imdbHref":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6973752/","subgenres":["Reality"]},"forged-in-fire-knife-or-death-3e3d5dd3-6a31-4b4b-8a3d-093e80b1b078":{"title":"Forged in Fire: Knife or Death","href":"https://www.hulu.com/series/forged-in-fire-knife-or-death-3e3d5dd3-6a31-4b4b-8a3d-093e80b1b078","id":"forged-in-fire-knife-or-death-3e3d5dd3-6a31-4b4b-8a3d-093e80b1b078","year":"2018","rating":"TVPG","description":"Each competitor takes a timed run through our obstacle course of challenges that test strength, hardness, sharpness & the blade's potential to inflict maximum damage- all in front of a live audience!

Foremost among them is MIKE LAWSON (Mark-Paul Gosselaar, “Franklin & Bash,” “NYPD Blue”), the team’s ruggedly handsome star catcher. There’s instant chemistry between them, although neither dares admit it. After all, Mike is captain of the team and a few of his players don’t even want Ginny on the field.

Amelia saw Ginny’s star potential early on and left her previous job as a Hollywood publicist to concentrate on the young phenom, bringing along her young assistant ELIOT (Tim Jo, “The Neighbors”).\n\nAlthough groomed for this moment by her demanding father, BILL BAKER (guest star Michael Beach, “Sons of Anarchy”), the end of Ginny’s improbable journey is the beginning of an almost impossible one: representing her gender as she embarks on a successful baseball career under the glare of the white-hot media spotlight.","starring":"","imdbScore":"7.4","imdbHref":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5500158/","subgenres":["Drama","Sports"]},"portrait-of-a-lady-on-fire-d514447d-1954-4bf8-8164-fa3d6fdfe73f":{"title":"Portrait of a Lady on Fire","href":"https://www.hulu.com/movie/portrait-of-a-lady-on-fire-d514447d-1954-4bf8-8164-fa3d6fdfe73f","id":"portrait-of-a-lady-on-fire-d514447d-1954-4bf8-8164-fa3d6fdfe73f","year":"2019","rating":"R","description":"In 18th century France a young painter, Marianne (Noémie Merlant), is commissioned to do the wedding portrait of Héloïse (Adèle Haenel).

The characters enjoy mouthwatering meals in gorgeous settings from Liguria to Capri while riffing on subjects as varied as Tom Hardy's vocal register as Bane, the artistic merits of 'Jagged Little Pill,' and, of course, the virtue of sequels.
