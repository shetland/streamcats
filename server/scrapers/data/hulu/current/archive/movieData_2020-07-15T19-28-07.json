Alone in a Paris theater after a long day of auditioning actresses for his new play, writer-director Thomas (Mathieu Amalric) complains that no actress he's seen has what it takes to play the lead female character: a woman who enters into an agreement with her male counterpart to dominate him as her slave. Thomas is about to leave the theater when actress Vanda (Emmanuelle Seigner) bursts in, a whirlwind of erratic - and, it turns out, erotic - energy. At first she seems to embody everything Thomas has been lamenting. She is pushy, foul-mouthed, desperate and ill-prepared - or so it seems. When Thomas finally, reluctantly, agrees to let her try out for the part, he is stunned and captivated by her transformation. Not only is Vanda a perfect fit (even sharing the character's name), but she apparently has researched the role exhaustively, learned her lines by heart and even bought her own props. The likeness proves to be much more than skin-deep. As the extended \"audition\" builds momentum, Thomas moves from attraction to obsession until, with Vanda taking an ever more dominant role, the balance of power shifts completely.","starring":"","imdbScore":"7.2","imdbHref":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2406252/","subgenres":["Comedy","Drama"]},{"title":"A Very Brady Christmas","href":"https://www.hulu.com/movie/a-very-brady-christmas-8447e16e-ddf0-4caa-81b1-b2f73424b4eb","id":"a-very-brady-christmas-8447e16e-ddf0-4caa-81b1-b2f73424b4eb","year":"1988","rating":"TVPG","description":"Deck the halls with love and laughter as the Brady Bunch comes home for Christmas!

Chris Burden guaranteed his place in art history in the 1970s with a series of often dangerous and at times stomach-churning performances. After having himself shot in Santa Ana, confined to a locker for five days in Irvine and crucified on the back of a VW bug in Venice, Burden reinvented himself as the creator of truly mesmerizing installations and sculptures, from a suspended gigantic flywheel that seemingly spins on its own to an assemblage of illuminated, antique streetlights outside the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, Urban Light (2008), which has become one of Los Angeles’ most photographed and iconic symbols. In Burden, Timothy Marrinan and Richard Dewey look at the artist’s work and private life with an innovative mix of still-potent videos of his 70s performances, personal films and audio recordings, latter day footage at his Topanga Canyon studio and comments from friends, fellow students, colleagues and critics, all peppered with Burden’s thoughts and musings from throughout the years.","starring":"","imdbScore":"6.2","imdbHref":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5314450/","subgenres":["Documentaries"]},{"title":"Burn","href":"https://www.hulu.com/movie/burn-5645e8b9-b95f-4b3f-af7e-bbd60273a502","id":"burn-5645e8b9-b95f-4b3f-af7e-bbd60273a502","year":"2012","rating":"NR","description":"An action-packed documentary about Detroit told through the eyes of firefighters charged with the thankless task of saving a city that many have written off as dead.","starring":"","imdbScore":"7.5","imdbHref":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1781784/","subgenres":["Documentaries"]},{"title":"Burn Mother...ker, Burn!.","href":"https://www.hulu.com/movie/burn-motherker-burn-491ee38b-45a7-41b5-81f4-1746be4e6a5a","id":"burn-motherker-burn-491ee38b-45a7-41b5-81f4-1746be4e6a5a","year":"2017","rating":"TVMA","description":"A provocative documentary look into the 1992 Los Angeles uprising.","starring":"","imdbScore":"6.6","imdbHref":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6175670/","subgenres":["Documentaries"]},{"title":"The Cage Fighter","href":"https://www.hulu.com/movie/the-cage-fighter-759b6dcd-a284-48ba-b89a-b965969ee5bb","id":"the-cage-fighter-759b6dcd-a284-48ba-b89a-b965969ee5bb","year":"2017","rating":"NR","description":"A mixed martial arts competitor risks everything—his family, his marriage, even his life—to keep fighting in this riveting, true-life tale of resilience.","starring":"","imdbScore":"5.9","imdbHref":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6436888/","subgenres":["Documentaries","Drama","Sports"]},{"title":"A Cam Life","href":"https://www.hulu.com/movie/a-cam-life-b9a69bd3-8ae5-41c8-8260-f505632826bb","id":"a-cam-life-b9a69bd3-8ae5-41c8-8260-f505632826bb","year":"2018","rating":"NR","description":"An undaunted look into the cam business from performers and clients to website and studio owners.","starring":"","imdbScore":"4.8","imdbHref":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5657764/","subgenres":["Documentaries"]},{"title":"Cannabis Evolution","href":"https://www.hulu.com/movie/cannabis-evolution-a25110e8-30bb-4fa9-aea5-b225580643a8","id":"cannabis-evolution-a25110e8-30bb-4fa9-aea5-b225580643a8","year":"2019","rating":"NR","description":"Science has confirmed marijuana has the potential to treat physical and mental conditions, from cancer to PTSD.

Painkillers give doctors tremendous power to relieve pain, a primary goal of any physician. But this power begets trouble when the same drugs can lead to addiction, abuse and death. The documentary traces Dr. Hurwitz's trial, detailing the events that lead to his arrest. Testimonies from witnesses in the case contradict one another - some revere him, while others condemn him. Taken together, their accounts reveal a portrait of a compassion yet flawed doctor. The film underscores the tension between every patient's right to pain relief and the lawful need for drug control. In 2016 prescription drugs kill more Americans than HIV or homicide, and more than heroin and cocaine combined. There could not be a more critical time to spark a discussion on this topic and call for careful though and action.","starring":"","imdbScore":"6.6","imdbHref":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5192362/","subgenres":["Documentaries"]},{"title":"Drag Kids.","href":"https://www.hulu.com/movie/drag-kids-df57c916-cc12-444c-bb7a-d3e2de5958e0","id":"drag-kids-df57c916-cc12-444c-bb7a-d3e2de5958e0","year":"2019","rating":"NR","description":"Four preteen drag queens come together for the biggest performance of their young lives.

Stanley Milgram (Peter Sarsgaard) designs a psychology experiment that remains relevant to this day, in which people think they’re delivering painful electric shocks to an affable stranger (Jim Gaffigan) strapped into a chair in another room. Disregarding his pleas for mercy, the majority of subjects do not stop the experiment, administering what they think are near-fatal electric shots, simply because they’ve been told to. Milgram’s exploration of authority and conformity strikes a nerve in popular culture and the scientific community. Celebrated in some circles, he is also accused of being a deceptive, manipulative monster.

Alone in a Paris theater after a long day of auditioning actresses for his new play, writer-director Thomas (Mathieu Amalric) complains that no actress he's seen has what it takes to play the lead female character: a woman who enters into an agreement with her male counterpart to dominate him as her slave. Thomas is about to leave the theater when actress Vanda (Emmanuelle Seigner) bursts in, a whirlwind of erratic - and, it turns out, erotic - energy. At first she seems to embody everything Thomas has been lamenting. She is pushy, foul-mouthed, desperate and ill-prepared - or so it seems. When Thomas finally, reluctantly, agrees to let her try out for the part, he is stunned and captivated by her transformation. Not only is Vanda a perfect fit (even sharing the character's name), but she apparently has researched the role exhaustively, learned her lines by heart and even bought her own props. The likeness proves to be much more than skin-deep. As the extended \"audition\" builds momentum, Thomas moves from attraction to obsession until, with Vanda taking an ever more dominant role, the balance of power shifts completely.","starring":"","imdbScore":"7.2","imdbHref":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2406252/","subgenres":["Comedy","Drama"]},{"title":"Vice","href":"https://www.hulu.com/movie/vice-9e2359f5-c334-43e2-b9cc-c4beeea666a2","id":"vice-9e2359f5-c334-43e2-b9cc-c4beeea666a2","year":"2018","rating":"R","description":"The
