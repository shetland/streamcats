High risk is their business and life-and-death stakes are their world. The SRU team is also unique; they rescue hostages, bust gangs, defuse bombs, climb buildings, see through walls and talk down suicidal teens. It takes years on the street, intense physical conditioning and elite marksmanship to qualify for the SRU. They have to prove that they’re at the top of their game on a daily basis because if they’re not, there are hundreds of others willing to step in and take their place. The team uses state-of-the-art equipment – sniper rifles, snake-cameras, robots, flash-bangs, night-vision and tasers. But beyond all of the cool gadgetry, the most important weapons in their arsenal are human intuition, a gift for words and their ability to read emotion. Each team member is uniquely trained in negotiating, profiling and getting inside a subject’s head. They stand out because of the rare balance between lethal hardware and people skills: pure muscle and pure intuition. They’re the envy of law enforcement everywhere. The stakes are always high in Flashpoint – only here, the lives of the men and women on the team are also always on the line. That’s the nature of the job. The SRU may be heroes, but they are also human. At the end of the day, they each go home haunted by what they’ve seen, by what they’ve had to do – pursued by new demons which they cram into already bulging closets. They lock down emotion and they second-guess decisions made in the heat of the moment. These individuals are constant witnesses to the extremes of human distress. Not everyone is cut out for this. If you’re a cop, you’re three times more likely to kill yourself than to be killed by a bad guy.","starring":"","imdbScore":"7.7","imdbHref":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1059475/?ref_=tt_ov_inf","subgenres":["Action","Crime","Drama","Thriller"]},{"title":"Full Metal Panic!","href":"https://www.hulu.com/series/full-metal-panic-348dc05a-07e2-40e7-8e47-f47067a61e4b","id":"full-metal-panic-348dc05a-07e2-40e7-8e47-f47067a61e4b","year":"2002","rating":"TVPG","description":"Sousuke Sagara, a seventeen year old military specialist working for the secret organization MITHRIL, has been assigned to protect the latest \"Whispered\" candidate Kaname Chidori.

Kirk a century earlier, and, accordingly, it carries a larger crew complement: 1,012 men, women…and, surprisingly, children.  This era’s Starfleet Command believes that men and women are more likely to sign up for long-term exploratory missions if they think of their ship as home. Thus, Picard’s crew enjoys many of the comforts they’d have otherwise left behind, including a wide variety of recreational opportunities, “replicated” food dishes to suit every palate, and quarters large enough to share with spouses and offspring. There are schools for the children and a bar (stocked with synthetic alcohol, or synthehol) where the adults can unwind. However, the ongoing mission—no longer limited to a mere five years—remains virtually the same as it was during Kirk’s time: to seek out new life and new civilizations, and to boldly go where no one has gone before.","starring":"","imdbScore":"8.6","imdbHref":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0092455/","subgenres":["Action","Adventure","Classics","Drama","Family","Science Fiction"]},{"title":"Star Trek: The Original Series","href":"https://www.hulu.com/series/star-trek-the-original-series-26f1ae35-0abd-4828-8786-7752ae7998d5","id":"star-trek-the-original-series-26f1ae35-0abd-4828-8786-7752ae7998d5","year":"1966","rating":"TVPG","description":"The 23rd century adventures of Captain James T.

Kirk a century earlier, and, accordingly, it carries a larger crew complement: 1,012 men, women…and, surprisingly, children.  This era’s Starfleet Command believes that men and women are more likely to sign up for long-term exploratory missions if they think of their ship as home. Thus, Picard’s crew enjoys many of the comforts they’d have otherwise left behind, including a wide variety of recreational opportunities, “replicated” food dishes to suit every palate, and quarters large enough to share with spouses and offspring. There are schools for the children and a bar (stocked with synthetic alcohol, or synthehol) where the adults can unwind. However, the ongoing mission—no longer limited to a mere five years—remains virtually the same as it was during Kirk’s time: to seek out new life and new civilizations, and to boldly go where no one has gone before.","starring":"","imdbScore":"8.6","imdbHref":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0092455/","subgenres":["Action","Adventure","Classics","Drama","Family","Science Fiction"]},{"title":"Star Trek: The Original Series","href":"https://www.hulu.com/series/star-trek-the-original-series-26f1ae35-0abd-4828-8786-7752ae7998d5","id":"star-trek-the-original-series-26f1ae35-0abd-4828-8786-7752ae7998d5","year":"1966","rating":"TVPG","description":"The 23rd century adventures of Captain James T.

Kirk a century earlier, and, accordingly, it carries a larger crew complement: 1,012 men, women…and, surprisingly, children.  This era’s Starfleet Command believes that men and women are more likely to sign up for long-term exploratory missions if they think of their ship as home. Thus, Picard’s crew enjoys many of the comforts they’d have otherwise left behind, including a wide variety of recreational opportunities, “replicated” food dishes to suit every palate, and quarters large enough to share with spouses and offspring. There are schools for the children and a bar (stocked with synthetic alcohol, or synthehol) where the adults can unwind. However, the ongoing mission—no longer limited to a mere five years—remains virtually the same as it was during Kirk’s time: to seek out new life and new civilizations, and to boldly go where no one has gone before.","starring":"","imdbScore":"8.6","imdbHref":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0092455/","subgenres":["Action","Adventure","Classics","Drama","Family","Science Fiction"]},{"title":"Star Trek: The Original Series","href":"https://www.hulu.com/series/star-trek-the-original-series-26f1ae35-0abd-4828-8786-7752ae7998d5","id":"star-trek-the-original-series-26f1ae35-0abd-4828-8786-7752ae7998d5","year":"1966","rating":"TVPG","description":"The 23rd century adventures of Captain James T.

The show was created by Carl Reiner and starred Dick Van Dyke and Mary Tyler Moore.\n\nTotalling 158 episodes and five seasons, the show was also produced by Reiner, who wrote many episodes and played the part of Alan Brady. Reiner based the main character of Rob Petrie on himself and the Alan Brady character on his former boss Sid Caesar. Many of the show's plots were inspired by Reiner's experiences as a writer for Your Show of Shows (which starred Caesar).  \n\nDick Van Dyke won three Emmy's for his portrayal of Rob Petrie and Mary Tyler Moore (who would alter go on to star in her own self-titled Emmy-winning series) won two Emmy's playing Dick's irascible, Capri pants-wearing wife, Laura.  The series was a launching pad for a slew of legendary comedians and artists, from director Garry Marshall and actress Rose Marie to comedians Jerry Farr and Don Rickles.\n\nStorylines deal with Rob Petrie and his two coworkers, Buddy and Sally, who write material for a television variety show.  Mel Cooley, a balding straight man is the show's producer and the brother-in-law of Alan Brady, the show's seldom-seen star. Other stories focus on the home life of Rob and Laura, who live in suburban New Rochelle, New York. Frequently seen is their young son, Ritchie, as well as their neighbors, Jerry and Millie Helper.","starring":"","imdbScore":"8.3","imdbHref":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0054533/","subgenres":["Classics","Comedy","Family","Sitcom"]},{"title":"Dietland","href":"https://www.hulu.com/series/dietland-b1bc42c3-3698-4ee6-a474-634b3c71283d","id":"dietland-b1bc42c3-3698-4ee6-a474-634b3c71283d","year":"2018","rating":"TVMA","description":"Dietland is a wickedly funny and extraordinarily-timed satire about the issues women face today.","starring":"","imdbScore":"6.4","imdbHref":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5869202/","subgenres":["Comedy","Drama"]},{"title":"Difficult People","href":"https://www.hulu.com/series/difficult-people-d865868f-0a63-4595-b48d-d651e7f67f7b","id":"difficult-people-d865868f-0a63-4595-b48d-d651e7f67f7b","year":"2015","rating":"TVMA","description":"Difficult People hails from Julie Klausner who stars alongside Emmy®-nominated Billy on the Street host Billy Eichner.

What’s more, Karen is pressing hard for Richard to get a vasectomy, his supervisor seems out to undermine him, his father calls with terrible news and his own therapist has become worryingly anally-fixated. In the midst of all this and most troubling of all, one disastrous past decision is threatening not just his sanity but his personal safety. And then there’s his clients, all who need his professional counsel, and a business that must succeed or he’ll never be free of the past.","starring":"","imdbScore":"6.3","imdbHref":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7411444/","subgenres":["Comedy"]},{"title":"Hangin' With Mr. Cooper","href":"https://www.hulu.com/series/hangin-with-mr-cooper-916bcb03-8dbe-478e-94e4-45734db1ddbb","id":"hangin-with-mr-cooper-916bcb03-8dbe-478e-94e4-45734db1ddbb","year":"1992","rating":"TVPG","description":"Life couldn't be better for Mark Cooper (Mark Curry).

And then, every so often, there's someone who sets out to do both. Set in Chicago, The Loop is the story of Sam (Bret Harrison), the youngest executive at the corporate headquarters of a major airline, and the first of his friends to get a real job. He must find a way to straddle his serious career and the serious social demands of his three roommates: Sully (Eric Christian Olsen), is Sam's older and rowdier brother, whose casual attempts to hold down a series of odd jobs are eclipsed by his attempts to land women. Roommate Piper (Amanda Loncar) is a medical student, Sam's college pal and -- unbeknownst to her -- his longtime crush.

Known for living up to their name, the band partied so long and so hard that even Keith Richards thought they needed to slow things down. The Heathens were on the brink of becoming famous for their kickass live shows and the release of their highly anticipated first album. Until they broke up. The same day the album dropped. Because lead guitarist Flash (John Corbett) found Johnny in bed with his wife. So the band became legendary for all the wrong reasons - like self-destructing sooner than any group in rock-n-roll history. 25 years later, the only thing bigger than Johnny’s ego is his prostate. The drugs he really needs now aren’t cocaine and marijuana – they’re Crestor, Cymbalta and Cialis. He’s out of work, out of money and out of show business options. That’s when a massively talented young singer named Gigi (Elizabeth Gillies) shows up - with a burning desire to be famous, a throwback appreciation for The Heathens’ only album, and a stack of cash big enough to bring the whole band back into the studio. Only this time, SHE’S the lead singer and Johnny’s just a behind-the-scenes songwriter. John Ales, Bobby Kelly and Elaine Hendrix round out the rest of this dysfunctional rock and roll family. The race is on to see who gets famous first - and for what reason.

High risk is their business and life-and-death stakes are their world. The SRU team is also unique; they rescue hostages, bust gangs, defuse bombs, climb buildings, see through walls and talk down suicidal teens. It takes years on the street, intense physical conditioning and elite marksmanship to qualify for the SRU. They have to prove that they’re at the top of their game on a daily basis because if they’re not, there are hundreds of others willing to step in and take their place. The team uses state-of-the-art equipment – sniper rifles, snake-cameras, robots, flash-bangs, night-vision and tasers. But beyond all of the cool gadgetry, the most important weapons in their arsenal are human intuition, a gift for words and their ability to read emotion. Each team member is uniquely trained in negotiating, profiling and getting inside a subject’s head. They stand out because of the rare balance between lethal hardware and people skills: pure muscle and pure intuition. They’re the envy of law enforcement everywhere. The stakes are always high in Flashpoint – only here, the lives of the men and women on the team are also always on the line. That’s the nature of the job. The SRU may be heroes, but they are also human. At the end of the day, they each go home haunted by what they’ve seen, by what they’ve had to do – pursued by new demons which they cram into already bulging closets. They lock down emotion and they second-guess decisions made in the heat of the moment. These individuals are constant witnesses to the extremes of human distress. Not everyone is cut out for this. If you’re a cop, you’re three times more likely to kill yourself than to be killed by a bad guy.","starring":"","imdbScore":"7.7","imdbHref":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1059475/?ref_=tt_ov_inf","subgenres":["Action","Crime","Drama","Thriller"]},{"title":"Forensic Files","href":"https://www.hulu.com/series/forensic-files-0d3f89ab-3879-4c2c-975b-aab579e0e471","id":"forensic-files-0d3f89ab-3879-4c2c-975b-aab579e0e471","year":"1996","rating":"TVMA","description":"Forensic Files profiles intriguing crimes, accidents, and outbreaks of disease from around the world.

But until now, nobody has undertaken a comprehensive look at super-orgasmic women – women who can experience over a hundred orgasms in any one sexual encounter. A new study by Canada’s prestigious McGill University, for the first time reveals statistics and testimonies from over 450 super-orgasmic women. Some of them can experience 10 orgasms - while others come hundreds of times, experiencing hours of pleasure. They vary in age and background, but have one thing in common: they are all still a mystery to scientists, as what actually happens to them has never been studied. But that’s all about to change. A group of super-orgasmic women who took part in the Canadian study are taking it to the next stage. They will now go into the laboratory and meet the best sex scientists in the world. The aim is to reveal if the orgasms are all in their heads or can we prove and somehow measure that this endless chain of pleasure is really happening? By deploying fMRI (functional magnetic resonance imaging) scans, scientists will be monitoring changes in blood flow to the brain, looking at which parts are most active and shedding light on what these women feel during orgasm. Past fMRI studies about single orgasms have seen scientists disagree – but what will this new research reveal and will we be any closer to understanding why some women are super-orgasmic?","starring":"","imdbScore":"N/A","imdbHref":"","subgenres":["Documentaries","International","Science & Technology"]},{"title":"Nightmare Next Door","href":"https://www.hulu.com/series/nightmare-next-door-c5ab8bf9-d6ed-4017-91c3-cfb481b3d747","id":"nightmare-next-door-c5ab8bf9-d6ed-4017-91c3-cfb481b3d747","year":"2013","rating":"TV14","description":"How well do you know your neighbors?

High risk is their business and life-and-death stakes are their world. The SRU team is also unique; they rescue hostages, bust gangs, defuse bombs, climb buildings, see through walls and talk down suicidal teens. It takes years on the street, intense physical conditioning and elite marksmanship to qualify for the SRU. They have to prove that they’re at the top of their game on a daily basis because if they’re not, there are hundreds of others willing to step in and take their place. The team uses state-of-the-art equipment – sniper rifles, snake-cameras, robots, flash-bangs, night-vision and tasers. But beyond all of the cool gadgetry, the most important weapons in their arsenal are human intuition, a gift for words and their ability to read emotion. Each team member is uniquely trained in negotiating, profiling and getting inside a subject’s head. They stand out because of the rare balance between lethal hardware and people skills: pure muscle and pure intuition. They’re the envy of law enforcement everywhere. The stakes are always high in Flashpoint – only here, the lives of the men and women on the team are also always on the line. That’s the nature of the job. The SRU may be heroes, but they are also human. At the end of the day, they each go home haunted by what they’ve seen, by what they’ve had to do – pursued by new demons which they cram into already bulging closets. They lock down emotion and they second-guess decisions made in the heat of the moment. These individuals are constant witnesses to the extremes of human distress. Not everyone is cut out for this. If you’re a cop, you’re three times more likely to kill yourself than to be killed by a bad guy.","starring":"","imdbScore":"7.7","imdbHref":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1059475/?ref_=tt_ov_inf","subgenres":["Action","Crime","Drama","Thriller"]},{"title":"Food Wars!","href":"https://www.hulu.com/series/food-wars-c3f514cd-df5e-47eb-9ab1-6e11236ef4f6","id":"food-wars-c3f514cd-df5e-47eb-9ab1-6e11236ef4f6","year":"2015","rating":"TVMA","description":"Souma is a teenage chef who is always looking for the perfect flavors and combinations in his art, the art of cooking.

Upon his return, Barry is immediately thrown back into the familial and national politics of his youth.  As he braces himself to confront the stark realities of his father and older brother Jamal’s (Ashraf Barhom) harsh rule, Barry is unable and unwilling to make his all-American family understand his unease over returning home.  His wife, Molly (Jennifer Finnigan), struggling to comprehend her husband’s apprehension, uncovers a romantic history involving Leila (Moran Atias), Jamal’s beautiful wife.

Kirk a century earlier, and, accordingly, it carries a larger crew complement: 1,012 men, women…and, surprisingly, children.  This era’s Starfleet Command believes that men and women are more likely to sign up for long-term exploratory missions if they think of their ship as home. Thus, Picard’s crew enjoys many of the comforts they’d have otherwise left behind, including a wide variety of recreational opportunities, “replicated” food dishes to suit every palate, and quarters large enough to share with spouses and offspring. There are schools for the children and a bar (stocked with synthetic alcohol, or synthehol) where the adults can unwind. However, the ongoing mission—no longer limited to a mere five years—remains virtually the same as it was during Kirk’s time: to seek out new life and new civilizations, and to boldly go where no one has gone before.","starring":"","imdbScore":"8.6","imdbHref":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0092455/","subgenres":["Action","Adventure","Classics","Drama","Family","Science Fiction"]},{"title":"Star Trek: The Original Series","href":"https://www.hulu.com/series/star-trek-the-original-series-26f1ae35-0abd-4828-8786-7752ae7998d5","id":"star-trek-the-original-series-26f1ae35-0abd-4828-8786-7752ae7998d5","year":"1966","rating":"TVPG","description":"The 23rd century adventures of Captain James T.

But until now, nobody has undertaken a comprehensive look at super-orgasmic women – women who can experience over a hundred orgasms in any one sexual encounter. A new study by Canada’s prestigious McGill University, for the first time reveals statistics and testimonies from over 450 super-orgasmic women. Some of them can experience 10 orgasms - while others come hundreds of times, experiencing hours of pleasure. They vary in age and background, but have one thing in common: they are all still a mystery to scientists, as what actually happens to them has never been studied. But that’s all about to change. A group of super-orgasmic women who took part in the Canadian study are taking it to the next stage. They will now go into the laboratory and meet the best sex scientists in the world. The aim is to reveal if the orgasms are all in their heads or can we prove and somehow measure that this endless chain of pleasure is really happening? By deploying fMRI (functional magnetic resonance imaging) scans, scientists will be monitoring changes in blood flow to the brain, looking at which parts are most active and shedding light on what these women feel during orgasm. Past fMRI studies about single orgasms have seen scientists disagree – but what will this new research reveal and will we be any closer to understanding why some women are super-orgasmic?","starring":"","imdbScore":"N/A","imdbHref":"","subgenres":["Documentaries","International","Science & Technology"]},{"title":"New Tricks","href":"https://www.hulu.com/series/new-tricks-1ec06883-a771-455e-8646-ea97185ba570","id":"new-tricks-1ec06883-a771-455e-8646-ea97185ba570","year":"2006","rating":"TV14","description":"A team of retired detectives with over 80 years service between them and very distinct personalities is recruited to re-examine unsolved crimes.

Known for living up to their name, the band partied so long and so hard that even Keith Richards thought they needed to slow things down. The Heathens were on the brink of becoming famous for their kickass live shows and the release of their highly anticipated first album. Until they broke up. The same day the album dropped. Because lead guitarist Flash (John Corbett) found Johnny in bed with his wife. So the band became legendary for all the wrong reasons - like self-destructing sooner than any group in rock-n-roll history. 25 years later, the only thing bigger than Johnny’s ego is his prostate. The drugs he really needs now aren’t cocaine and marijuana – they’re Crestor, Cymbalta and Cialis. He’s out of work, out of money and out of show business options. That’s when a massively talented young singer named Gigi (Elizabeth Gillies) shows up - with a burning desire to be famous, a throwback appreciation for The Heathens’ only album, and a stack of cash big enough to bring the whole band back into the studio. Only this time, SHE’S the lead singer and Johnny’s just a behind-the-scenes songwriter. John Ales, Bobby Kelly and Elaine Hendrix round out the rest of this dysfunctional rock and roll family. The race is on to see who gets famous first - and for what reason.

At the other end of the scale we’ll reveal how high street favourites such as LK Bennett, Reiss and Hobbs are regular choices and how small, niche labels like Goat, Preen, Me & Em and maternity specialist Seraphine have seen their businesses boom after being worn by the Duchess.

But until now, nobody has undertaken a comprehensive look at super-orgasmic women – women who can experience over a hundred orgasms in any one sexual encounter. A new study by Canada’s prestigious McGill University, for the first time reveals statistics and testimonies from over 450 super-orgasmic women. Some of them can experience 10 orgasms - while others come hundreds of times, experiencing hours of pleasure. They vary in age and background, but have one thing in common: they are all still a mystery to scientists, as what actually happens to them has never been studied. But that’s all about to change. A group of super-orgasmic women who took part in the Canadian study are taking it to the next stage. They will now go into the laboratory and meet the best sex scientists in the world. The aim is to reveal if the orgasms are all in their heads or can we prove and somehow measure that this endless chain of pleasure is really happening? By deploying fMRI (functional magnetic resonance imaging) scans, scientists will be monitoring changes in blood flow to the brain, looking at which parts are most active and shedding light on what these women feel during orgasm. Past fMRI studies about single orgasms have seen scientists disagree – but what will this new research reveal and will we be any closer to understanding why some women are super-orgasmic?","starring":"","imdbScore":"N/A","imdbHref":"","subgenres":["Documentaries","International","Science & Technology"]},{"title":"The New York Times Presents.","href":"https://www.hulu.com/series/the-new-york-times-presents-f22278d1-ef56-40e8-9227-af3a029ca6f4","id":"the-new-york-times-presents-f22278d1-ef56-40e8-9227-af3a029ca6f4","year":"2020","rating":"TVMA","description":"The New York Times Presents is a series of standalone documentaries representing the unparalleled journalism and insight of The New York Times, bringing viewers close to the essential stories of our time.","starring":"","imdbScore":"4.8","imdbHref":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt12673630/","subgenres":["News"]},{"title":"Our New Reality: A Diane Sawyer Special.","href":"https://www.hulu.com/series/our-new-reality-a-diane-sawyer-special-cb6807a0-ecd3-45e2-b0c1-4972d1e2deb3","id":"our-new-reality-a-diane-sawyer-special-cb6807a0-ecd3-45e2-b0c1-4972d1e2deb3","year":"2020","rating":"NR","description":"Exploring the COVID-19 crisis and the way forward; interviews with scientists racing to find a vaccine and everyday Americans volunteering for testing; the lives of essential workers on the frontlines.","starring":"","imdbScore":"N/A","imdbHref":"","subgenres":["Documentaries","News"]},{"title":"Out There with Jack Randall","href":"https://www.hulu.com/series/out-there-with-jack-randall-6354c80f-366e-424a-aa87-e3560e083b8a","id":"out-there-with-jack-randall-6354c80f-366e-424a-aa87-e3560e083b8a","year":"2019","rating":"TV14","description":"Jack ventures into the remote Northern Territory in Australia where he dives into crocodile-infested swamps, reaches into giant lizards' burrows and crawls through dark, cramped caves to find six dangerous pythons.","starring":"","imdbScore":"7.0","imdbHref":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10583412/","subgenres":["Reality","Science & Technology"]},{"title":"Politicking With Larry King","href":"https://www.hulu.com/series/politicking-with-larry-king-07f4f6b7-6157-445e-aa96-a291e3717075","id":"politicking-with-larry-king-07f4f6b7-6157-445e-aa96-a291e3717075","year":"2013","rating":"TV14","description":"The biggest names in politics join iconic host Larry King for a frank and unfiltered discussion of today's headlines.","starring":"","imdbScore":"5.4","imdbHref":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5136220/","subgenres":["News"]},{"title":"The Room Where It Happened: ABC News Exclusive Interview With John Bolton","href":"https://www.hulu.com/series/the-room-where-it-happened-abc-news-exclusive-interview-with-john-bolton-8a3fdde8-0c0a-4bf3-8289-d35bbe337249","id":"the-room-where-it-happened-abc-news-exclusive-interview-with-john-bolton-8a3fdde8-0c0a-4bf3-8289-d35bbe337249","year":"2020","rating":"NR","description":"Martha Raddatz speaks with John Bolton, former national security adviser to President Donald Trump, about his new book, \"The Room Where It Happened: A White House Memoir.\"","starring":"","imdbScore":"N/A","imdbHref":"","subgenres":["News"]},{"title":"Susan Powell: An ID Murder Mystery","href":"https://www.hulu.com/series/susan-powell-an-id-murder-mystery-308e3a2e-c197-4b69-bcf0-3768103b9a52","id":"susan-powell-an-id-murder-mystery-308e3a2e-c197-4b69-bcf0-3768103b9a52","year":"2018","rating":"TV14","description":"When Susan Powell vanishes without a trace, her husband claims to have no idea what happened.

But until now, nobody has undertaken a comprehensive look at super-orgasmic women – women who can experience over a hundred orgasms in any one sexual encounter. A new study by Canada’s prestigious McGill University, for the first time reveals statistics and testimonies from over 450 super-orgasmic women. Some of them can experience 10 orgasms - while others come hundreds of times, experiencing hours of pleasure. They vary in age and background, but have one thing in common: they are all still a mystery to scientists, as what actually happens to them has never been studied. But that’s all about to change. A group of super-orgasmic women who took part in the Canadian study are taking it to the next stage. They will now go into the laboratory and meet the best sex scientists in the world. The aim is to reveal if the orgasms are all in their heads or can we prove and somehow measure that this endless chain of pleasure is really happening? By deploying fMRI (functional magnetic resonance imaging) scans, scientists will be monitoring changes in blood flow to the brain, looking at which parts are most active and shedding light on what these women feel during orgasm. Past fMRI studies about single orgasms have seen scientists disagree – but what will this new research reveal and will we be any closer to understanding why some women are super-orgasmic?","starring":"","imdbScore":"N/A","imdbHref":"","subgenres":["Documentaries","International","Science & Technology"]},{"title":"Out There with Jack Randall","href":"https://www.hulu.com/series/out-there-with-jack-randall-6354c80f-366e-424a-aa87-e3560e083b8a","id":"out-there-with-jack-randall-6354c80f-366e-424a-aa87-e3560e083b8a","year":"2019","rating":"TV14","description":"Jack ventures into the remote Northern Territory in Australia where he dives into crocodile-infested swamps, reaches into giant lizards' burrows and crawls through dark, cramped caves to find six dangerous pythons.","starring":"","imdbScore":"7.0","imdbHref":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10583412/","subgenres":["Reality","Science & Technology"]},{"title":"River Monsters","href":"https://www.hulu.com/series/river-monsters-1feedd0c-1f4a-4fb1-9dbb-ecca42a494a1","id":"river-monsters-1feedd0c-1f4a-4fb1-9dbb-ecca42a494a1","year":"2013","rating":"TVPG","description":"Join biologist and extreme angler Jeremy Wade, as he catches the extraordinary and supersized fish that lurk in our planet's rivers and lakes.","starring":"","imdbScore":"8.2","imdbHref":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1476750/","subgenres":["Documentaries","Reality","Science & Technology"]},{"title":"Ronda Rousey Uncaged.","href":"https://www.hulu.com/series/ronda-rousey-uncaged-444c3a9f-f61d-478a-8263-84503812aa97","id":"ronda-rousey-uncaged-444c3a9f-f61d-478a-8263-84503812aa97","year":"2018","rating":"TVPG","description":"Professional wrestler Ronda Rousey is trained by shark conservationist Paul de Gelder to face her fiercest opponent yet, the mako shark; in New Zealand, Rousey free dives with the mako shark to prove she can confront her greatest fear.","starring":"","imdbScore":"N/A","imdbHref":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8839368/","subgenres":["Action","Reality","Science & Technology"]},{"title":"Shaq Does Shark Week.","href":"https://www.hulu.com/series/shaq-does-shark-week-229a4ea2-c8de-4a21-827d-85959f3836c9","id":"shaq-does-shark-week-229a4ea2-c8de-4a21-827d-85959f3836c9","year":"2018","rating":"TVPG","description":"Former NBA basketball player Shaquille O'Neal strives to overcome his fear of sharks with the help of comic Rob Riggle, a retired U.S. Marine Corps Reserve officer, who helps train him at Atlantis, Paradise Island, in the Bahamas, for the big plunge.","starring":"","imdbScore":"6.8","imdbHref":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8768630/","subgenres":["Documentaries","Reality","Science & Technology"]},{"title":"Shark Movers: Deadly Cargo","href":"https://www.hulu.com/series/shark-movers-deadly-cargo-abcb4f27-eeab-4874-98f7-82e6be775ac5","id":"shark-movers-deadly-cargo-abcb4f27-eeab-4874-98f7-82e6be775ac5","year":"2019","rating":"TVPG","description":"Scientists Dr. Laurent Vigliola and Dr. Will Robbins catch, crane-lift, and relocate several bull sharks from Nouméa, New Caledonia, to a pristine coral reef in hopes they will adapt to a new home away from people and learn to feed in the wild.","starring":"","imdbScore":"N/A","imdbHref":"","subgenres":["Documentaries","Science & Technology"]},{"title":"Shark Storm","href":"https://www.hulu.com/series/shark-storm-f5004096-61b9-4ff6-ac56-0a51018b5058","id":"shark-storm-f5004096-61b9-4ff6-ac56-0a51018b5058","year":"2017","rating":"TVPG","description":"At various times of the year and in different locations around the world, sharks of many kinds gather, swarm, and spiral; Dr. Tristan Guttridge conducts a study to find out what brings them together and what's going on in these shark societies.","starring":"","imdbScore":"N/A","imdbHref":"","subgenres":["Documentaries","Science & Technology"]},{"title":"Shark Week","href":"https://www.hulu.com/series/shark-week-2a7c459f-71c0-40ad-86d0-d8abc896537d","id":"shark-week-2a7c459f-71c0-40ad-86d0-d8abc896537d","year":"2013","rating":"TVG","description":"Shark Week exposes you to the incredible truths about sharks as perfect predatory machines.

Enterprise (NCC-1701-D). This incarnation of the famous starship is much larger than the one captained by James T. Kirk a century earlier, and, accordingly, it carries a larger crew complement: 1,012 men, women…and, surprisingly, children.  This era’s Starfleet Command believes that men and women are more likely to sign up for long-term exploratory missions if they think of their ship as home. Thus, Picard’s crew enjoys many of the comforts they’d have otherwise left behind, including a wide variety of recreational opportunities, “replicated” food dishes to suit every palate, and quarters large enough to share with spouses and offspring.

And then, every so often, there's someone who sets out to do both. Set in Chicago, The Loop is the story of Sam (Bret Harrison), the youngest executive at the corporate headquarters of a major airline, and the first of his friends to get a real job. He must find a way to straddle his serious career and the serious social demands of his three roommates: Sully (Eric Christian Olsen), is Sam's older and rowdier brother, whose casual attempts to hold down a series of odd jobs are eclipsed by his attempts to land women. Roommate Piper (Amanda Loncar) is a medical student, Sam's college pal and -- unbeknownst to her -- his longtime crush. And roommate Lizzy (Sarah Mason), who tends bar at their local hangout, is oblivious to the fact that everything always goes her way because she's so smoking hot. As Sam strives to meet the relentless demands of his boss Russ (Philip Baker Hall), dodge the nonstop advances of his colleague Meryl (Mimi Rogers), manage his overqualified and somewhat bitter secretary Darcy (Joy Osmanski), and turn his best-friendship with Piper into romance, he is, by turns, ambitious, exhausted and inspired. Moreover, he is a hero for everyone who has ever tried to work hard and play hard at the same time.","starring":"","imdbScore":"7.4","imdbHref":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0460655/","subgenres":["Comedy","Sitcom"]},{"title":"Love Thy Neighbor","href":"https://www.hulu.com/series/love-thy-neighbor-f76e8b71-b75d-4462-afe4-d8352194a0fd","id":"love-thy-neighbor-f76e8b71-b75d-4462-afe4-d8352194a0fd","year":"2013","rating":"TV14","description":"A comedy series by Tyler Perry follows daily struggles/triumphs of the Love family.

Known for living up to their name, the band partied so long and so hard that even Keith Richards thought they needed to slow things down. The Heathens were on the brink of becoming famous for their kickass live shows and the release of their highly anticipated first album. Until they broke up. The same day the album dropped. Because lead guitarist Flash (John Corbett) found Johnny in bed with his wife. So the band became legendary for all the wrong reasons - like self-destructing sooner than any group in rock-n-roll history. 25 years later, the only thing bigger than Johnny’s ego is his prostate. The drugs he really needs now aren’t cocaine and marijuana – they’re Crestor, Cymbalta and Cialis. He’s out of work, out of money and out of show business options. That’s when a massively talented young singer named Gigi (Elizabeth Gillies) shows up - with a burning desire to be famous, a throwback appreciation for The Heathens’ only album, and a stack of cash big enough to bring the whole band back into the studio. Only this time, SHE’S the lead singer and Johnny’s just a behind-the-scenes songwriter. John Ales, Bobby Kelly and Elaine Hendrix round out the rest of this dysfunctional rock and roll family. The race is on to see who gets famous first - and for what reason.

High risk is their business and life-and-death stakes are their world. The SRU team is also unique; they rescue hostages, bust gangs, defuse bombs, climb buildings, see through walls and talk down suicidal teens. It takes years on the street, intense physical conditioning and elite marksmanship to qualify for the SRU. They have to prove that they’re at the top of their game on a daily basis because if they’re not, there are hundreds of others willing to step in and take their place. The team uses state-of-the-art equipment – sniper rifles, snake-cameras, robots, flash-bangs, night-vision and tasers. But beyond all of the cool gadgetry, the most important weapons in their arsenal are human intuition, a gift for words and their ability to read emotion. Each team member is uniquely trained in negotiating, profiling and getting inside a subject’s head. They stand out because of the rare balance between lethal hardware and people skills: pure muscle and pure intuition. They’re the envy of law enforcement everywhere. The stakes are always high in Flashpoint – only here, the lives of the men and women on the team are also always on the line. That’s the nature of the job. The SRU may be heroes, but they are also human. At the end of the day, they each go home haunted by what they’ve seen, by what they’ve had to do – pursued by new demons which they cram into already bulging closets. They lock down emotion and they second-guess decisions made in the heat of the moment. These individuals are constant witnesses to the extremes of human distress. Not everyone is cut out for this. If you’re a cop, you’re three times more likely to kill yourself than to be killed by a bad guy.","starring":"","imdbScore":"7.7","imdbHref":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1059475/?ref_=tt_ov_inf","subgenres":["Action","Crime","Drama","Thriller"]},{"title":"The Future Diary","href":"https://www.hulu.com/series/the-future-diary-0c43ee4a-8e87-4864-8496-7b215c2a3976","id":"the-future-diary-0c43ee4a-8e87-4864-8496-7b215c2a3976","year":"2011","rating":"TVMA","description":"One day, Yukiteru discovers that his cell phone \"diary\" can now tell him the events of the future.
